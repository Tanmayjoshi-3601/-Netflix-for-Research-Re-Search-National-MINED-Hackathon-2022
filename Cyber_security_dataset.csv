Defenders can use TTP intelligence to perform the penetration test and compensate for defense deficiency. However, most TTP intelligence is described in unstructured threat data, such as APT analysis reports. Manually converting natural language TTPs descriptions to standard TTP names, such as ATT&CK TTP names and IDs, is time-consuming and requires deep expertise. In this paper, we define the TTP classification task as a sentence classification task. We annotate a new sentence-level TTP dataset with 6 categories and 6061 TTP descriptions from 10761 security analysis reports. We construct a threat context-enhanced TTP intelligence mining (TIM) framework to mine TTP intelligence from unstructured threat data. The TIM framework uses TCENet (Threat Context Enhanced Network) to find and classify TTP descriptions, which we define as three continuous sentences, from textual data. Meanwhile, we use the element features of TTP in the descriptions to enhance the TTPs classification accuracy of TCENet. The evaluation result shows that the average classification accuracy of our proposed method on the 6 TTP categories reaches 0.941. The evaluation results also show that adding TTP element features can improve our classification accuracy compared to using only text features. TCENet also achieved the best results compared to the previous document-level TTP classification works and other popular text classification methods, even in the case of few-shot training samples. Finally, the TIM framework organizes TTP descriptions and TTP elements into STIX 2.1 format as final TTP intelligence for sharing the long-period and essential attack behavior characteristics of attackers. In addition, we transform TTP intelligence into sigma detection rules for attack behavior detection. Such TTP intelligence and rules can help defenders deploy long-term effective threat detection and perform more realistic attack simulations to strengthen defense. © 2022, The Author(s).","Advanced persistent threat (APT); Natural language processing (NLP); Threat intelligence; TTPs","Classification (of information); Information retrieval systems; Network security; Text processing; Advanced persistent threat; Attack behavior; Classification accuracy; Classification tasks; Essential features; Evaluation results; Natural language processing; Penetration test; Tactic, technique, and procedure; Threat intelligence; Natural language processing systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124044077

An informationally structured environment is vital for developing intelligent service robots by embedding various sensors in the environment to enhance the sensing capability and intelligence of robots. Thus far, we have been developing a software platform, named ROS-TMS, for an informationally structured environment, which connects various sensors and robots using ROS architecture. In recent years, ROS2, a next-generation version of ROS, has been released. ROS2 has many advantages, such as enhanced security, QoS control, and support for various platforms. ROS2-TMS, a new version of ROS-TMS, is developed not only by porting existing modules in ROS-TMS, such as the control system for a communication robot, but also by adding useful functions utilizing new features in ROS2. For instance, we added a voice user interface to control robots and various devices in the environment, such as lights or a bed. In addition, we implemented a new task scheduler that provides a cancelation function to stop running tasks and improve the security of the platform. © 2022, The Author(s).","Ambient sensing; Cyber physical system; Informationally structured environment; Internet of things; Service robot","Embedded systems; Intelligent robots; Internet of things; Mobile robots; User interfaces; Ambient sensing; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Embeddings; Informationally structured environment; Intelligent Service robots; QoS support; Service robots; Software platforms; Structured environment; Cyber Physical System",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124008424

A solution approach is to leverage cloud resources for storing blocks within the chain. The paper, therefore, proposes two solutions to this problem. The first being an improved hybrid architecture design which uses containerization to create a side chain on a fog node for the devices connected to it and an Advanced Time-variant Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (AT-MOPSO) for determining the optimal number of blocks that should be transferred to the cloud for storage. This algorithm uses time-variant weights for the velocity of the particle swarm optimization and the non-dominated sorting and mutation schemes from NSGA-III. The proposed algorithm was compared with results from the original MOPSO algorithm, the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA-II), and the Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm with region-based selection (PESA-II), and NSGA-III. The proposed AT-MOPSO showed better results than the aforementioned MOPSO algorithms in cloud storage cost and query probability optimization. Importantly, AT-MOPSO achieved 52% energy efficiency compared to NSGA-III. To show how this algorithm can be applied to a real-world Blockchain system, the BISS industrial Blockchain architecture was adapted and modified to show how the AT-MOPSO can be used with existing Blockchain systems and the benefits it provides. © 2021, The Author(s).","Blockchain; Cloud storage; Internet of Things; Particle swarm optimization; Scalability","Blockchain; Energy efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Internet of things; Multiobjective optimization; Screening; Architecture designs; Block-chain; Cloud storages; Hybrid architectures; Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms; Side-chains; Solution approach; Storage optimization; Storage requirements; Time variant; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122333565

The trend also facilitates numerous relevant applications, e.g., smart health care, smart office, smart campus, etc., and drives the urgent demand for data sharing. However, this brings many concerns on data security as there is more private and sensitive information contained in the data of smart city applications. It may incur disastrous consequences if the shared data are illegally accessed, which necessitates an efficient data access control scheme for data sharing in smart city applications with resource-poor user terminals. To this end, we proposes an efficient traceable and revocable time-based CP-ABE (TR-TABE) scheme which can achieve time-based and fine-grained data access control over large attribute universe for data sharing in large-scale smart city applications. To trace and punish the malicious users that intentionally leak their keys to pursue illicit profits, we design an efficient user tracing and revocation mechanism with forward and backward security. For efficiency improvement, we integrate outsourced decryption and verify the correctness of its result. The proposed scheme is proved secure with formal security proof and is demonstrated to be practical for data sharing in smart city applications with extensive performance evaluation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Attribute-based encryption; Revocability; Time-based access control; Traceability; Verifiable outsourced decryption","Cryptography; Digital storage; Fog computing; Internet of things; Smart city; Attribute-based encryptions; Cloud-computing; Data access control; Data Sharing; Revocability; Service patterns; Time based; Time-based access control; Traceability; Verifiable outsourced decryption; Access control",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122306114

Several approaches have been introduced and implemented to thwart malicious activities so far. Due to the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) methods, the proposed approach applied several ML models for the intrusion detection system. In order to evaluate the performance of models, UNSW-NB 15 and Network TON_IoT datasets were used for offline analysis. Both datasets are comparatively newer than the NSL-KDD dataset to represent modern-day attacks. However, the performance analysis was carried out by training and testing the Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), AdaBoost, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for the binary classification task. As the performance of IDS deteriorates with a high dimensional feature vector, an optimum set of features was selected through a Gini Impurity-based Weighted Random Forest (GIWRF) model as the embedded feature selection technique. This technique employed Gini impurity as the splitting criterion of trees and adjusted the weights for two different classes of the imbalanced data to make the learning algorithm understand the class distribution. Based upon the importance score, 20 features were selected from UNSW-NB 15 and 10 features from the Network TON_IoT dataset. The experimental result revealed that DT performed well with the feature selection technique than other trained models of this experiment. Moreover, the proposed GIWRF-DT outperformed other existing methods surveyed in the literature in terms of the F1 score. © 2022, The Author(s).","Cyber security; Feature selection; Intrusion Detection System; Machine learning; Network security","Adaptive boosting; Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Long short-term memory; Statistical tests; Cyber security; Features selection; Gini impurities; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning models; Networks security; Performance; Performances analysis; Random forests; Selection techniques; Network security",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122296943

In contrast to the existing models, the studied process is described by a simplified queuing system, reduced to a discrete Markov chain. The controlled parameter is the total amount of occupied system resources for all active sessions subject system interaction. Based on the created model, the metric of parameters that fully characterize the quality of functioning of the studied IoT system is analytically described. The proposed metric includes such stochastic characteristic parameters as the average number of active sessions of subject-system interaction in the information environment of the IoT system, the average amount of occupied system resources, and the probability of losing incoming requests due to insufficient free system resources or lack of free communication channels. The dependence of the mentioned stochastic characteristic parameters on the type and settings of the distribution function of the released system resources volume is also analytically formalized. The proposed expressions also consider the workload level of the front-end interface of the IoT system and the desired amount of system resources specified in the input request. The experiments showed that with the increasing workload on the front-end interface of the studied IoT system, the values of all characteristic parameters of the metric increase. In particular, for the studied system with an increase in load in the range from 0.8 to 1.1: - the average number of active sessions of subject-system interaction increased linearly from 11 to 16; - the average amount of occupied system resources gradually increased nonlinearly from 72% to 93%; - the probability of losing an incoming request increased exponentially from 5% to 18%. Note that the increase in the value of the probability of loss of incoming requests is exponential. It is established that the reason for such growth is the growth of variance of the main characteristic parameter of incoming requests – the value of the desired amount of system resources. The geometric distribution-based system resource management scheme also found that it mainly satisfies incoming requests with a smaller value of the desired amount of system resources and, in general, is focused on supporting already active sessions of subject-system interaction. The proposed mathematical apparatus can be used at the design stage of client-oriented 4G-LTE, 5G, and, potentially, 6G ecosystems. © 2022","5G-IoT ecosystem; Availability; discrete Markov chain; Quality metric; Subject-system interaction session","Availability; Distribution functions; Ecosystems; Internet of things; Markov processes; Parameter estimation; Quality control; Stochastic systems; 5g-IoT ecosystem; Average numbers; Characteristics parameters; Discrete markov chain; Front end; Quality metrices; Stochastic characteristic; Subject-system interaction session; System interactions; System resources; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123838122

Worse still, the proof idea of the leakage resilience of FS-Sig schemes based on traditional number-theoretic assumptions does not apply to most lattice-based FS-Sig schemes. For this, we propose a framework to construct fully leakage resilient lattice-based FS-Sig schemes in the bounded memory leakage (BML) model. The framework consists of two parts. The first part shows how to construct leakage resilient FS-Sig schemes in BML model from leakage resilient versions of non-lossy or lossy identification schemes, which can be instantiated based on lattice assumptions. The second part shows how to construct fully leakage resilient FS-Sig schemes based on leakage resilient ones together with a new property called state reconstruction. We show almost all lattice-based FS-Sig schemes have this property. As a concrete application of our fundamental framework, we apply it to existing lattice-based FS-Sig schemes and provide analysis results of their security in the leakage setting. © 2022, Higher Education Press.","Fiat-Shamir paradigm; lattice-based signatures; leakage resilience; post-quantum cryptography; side-channel attacks","Authentication; Network security; Quantum cryptography; Bounded memory; Fiat-Shamir; Fiat-shamir paradigm; Fiat-Shamir signatures; Lattice-based; Lattice-based signature; Leakage-resilience; Post quantum cryptography; Side-channel attacks; Signature Scheme; Side channel attack",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122700129

Existing studies have explored the cloudlet placement problem in a homogeneous scenario with different goals such as latency minimization, load balancing, energy efficiency, and placement cost minimization. However, placing cloudlets in a highly heterogeneous deployment scenario considering the next-generation 5G networks and IoT applications is still an open challenge. The novel requirements of these applications indicate that there is still a gap in ensuring low-latency service guarantees when deploying cloudlets. Furthermore, deploying cloudlets in a cost-effective manner and ensuring full coverage for all users in edge computing are other critical conflicting issues. In this article, we address these issues by designing a bifactor approximation algorithm to solve the heterogeneous cloudlet placement problem to guarantee a bounded latency and placement cost, while fully mapping user applications to appropriate cloudlets. We first formulate the problem as a multi-objective integer programming model and show that it is a computationally NP-hard problem. We then propose a bifactor approximation algorithm, ACP, to tackle its intractability. We investigate the effectiveness of ACP by performing extensive theoretical analysis and experiments on multiple deployment scenarios based on New York City OpenData. We prove that ACP provides a (2,4)-approximation ratio for the latency and the placement cost. The experimental results show that ACP obtains near-optimal results in a polynomial running time making it suitable for both short-term and long-term cloudlet placement in heterogeneous deployment scenarios. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","approximation algorithm; cloudlets; Edge computing; full coverage; latency; placement cost","5G mobile communication systems; Approximation algorithms; Costs; Edge computing; Integer programming; Cloud-computing; Cloudlet; Deployment scenarios; Edge computing; Full coverage; Latency; Low latency; Low-latency communication; Placement cost; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120571728

In SDNs, communication has a crucial role, but, cyber-physical security of the communication system is exceedingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks (CAs), especially in the consumer's sector. So, this paper aims to propose an approach for designing cyber-secure SDN (CSDN) by considering the problem as a dynamic model of tri-level cyber-secure SDNEP (CSDNEP) program. The procedure includes the design of SDN as a meshed topology equipped by multi-type switching devices, utilization of multi-type distributed generations, and demand response.

While this integration enables advanced system diagnostics, monitoring, and control, it also exposes the physical process to cyber-threats. Critical infrastructures such as nuclear power plants may be targeted by a variety of threat agents, each with unique motivations, resources, and capabilities. A Bayesian game-theoretic approach is presented to secure critical infrastructure when the adversary's characteristics are uncertain. In a Bayesian game, some players have incomplete information about the other players. Within the context of critical infrastructure cybersecurity, plant defenders have incomplete information about threat agents, and threat agents have incomplete information about plant defenders. A Bayesian game provides a quantitative method for security teams to identify optimal defense strategies. The Bayesian game-theoretic approach is demonstrated on the residual heat removal system of a boiling water reactor. Threat agents are modeled as types in the game using a threat agent library that defines each threat's characteristics. Similarly, different types of defenders are modeled by considering consequences of importance to plant stakeholders. Using these type definitions, utility functions are defined for each player. Nash equilibria of the Stackelberg game and two simultaneous games are identified and discussed. Using this procedure, a security team at a nuclear power plant can select the optimal strategy to defend the plant from cyber-threats. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cyber–physical systems; Game theory; Industrial control systems; Security; Threat modeling; Uncertainty","Computation theory; Critical infrastructures; Cybersecurity; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Public works; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian game; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber security; Cyber-physical systems; Incomplete information; Industrial control systems; Security; Threat agents; Threat modeling; Uncertainty; Game theory",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124263929

Its strong dependencies on digital communication technology bring up new vulnerabilities. Among the existing cyber-attacks, false data injection (FDI) attack is targeted at compromising power system state estimation by injecting false data into meter measurements. Such a malicious attack cannot be identified by the traditional bad data detection (BDD) techniques. According to this problem, finding a way to detect this kind of attack is necessary. Therefore, to overcome this problem, extremely randomized trees algorithm is proposed in this paper because of its high accuracy and fastness compared with other algorithms like support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). It is evident that as the system size increases, the computational complexity increases.

Notably, it has become apparent that the convergence and amalgamation of Industrial Operational Technology (OT) with Information Technology (IT) brings about sophiscation, IIoT ecosystem complexities, paradigm shift and overall changes in security and digital forensic investigation architectures.

Cyberspace security threats stem from the problem of endogenous security, which is caused by the incompleteness of theoretical system and technology of the information field itself. Thus it is impossible and unnecessary for us to build an 'aseptic' cyberspace. On the contrast, we must focus on improving the 'self-immunity' of network. Literally, endogenous security is an endogenous effect from its own structural factors rather than external ones. The t/kt/k-diagnosis strategy plays a very important role in measuring endogenous network security without prior knowledge, which can significantly enhance the self-diagnosing capability of network. As far as we know, few research involves t/kt/k-diagnosis algorithm and t/kt/k-diagnosability of interconnection networks under MM∗ model.

We determine that the t/kt/k-diagnosability (t(G)/k)M(t(G)/k)M of GG under MM∗ model is f(r,k+1)f(r,k+1) by GGMISkkDIAGMM∗ algorithm. Moreover, we establish the (t(G)/k)M(t(G)/k)M of some interconnection networks under MM∗ model, including BC networks, (n,l)(n,l)-star graph networks, and data center network DCells. Finally, we compare (t(G)/k)M(t(G)/k)M with diagnosability, conditional diagnosability, pessimistic diagnosability, extra diagnosability, and good-neighbor diagnosability under MM∗ model.

Suffering from data tampering attacks, PLCs are fragile as the forged data could cause significant damage to industrial machines and human safety. However, less attention has been paid to develop resilience mechanisms for automatically recovering PLCs systems from anomalous states under malicious attacks. In this work, we present the first resilience approach for protecting PLCs against data tampering attacks. The key observation we leverage is that the programmable characteristic of a PLC enables a defender to ensure its data integrity by embedding security mechanism into its control logic. In particular, we design a novel data authentication mechanism to generate and authenticate the message digest of the communication data between PLCs. An anomaly alert will be triggered if the data authentication fails. The execution on received malicious commands is disabled to avoid detrimental effect and keep the system stable. Furthermore, to recover real data from malicious modifications, a data sender is required to encrypt data using the proposed RC5-based data recovery algorithm and re-transmit it. The data authentication and recovery approaches can be implemented on the programmable logic circuit of PLCs through code updating, which requires no alterations to its current hardware architecture. We present the prototype of our resilience scheme and conduct real-world experiments to validate its efficacy under 12 typical attack scenarios. Our results show that our approach achieves 97.4% of accuracy in data authentication and 98.1% of success rate in abnormal state recovery.

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose SG-PBFT (Score Grouping-PBFT), a secure and efficient distributed consensus algorithm for blockchain applications in the IoV. The distributed structure can reduce the pressure on the central server and decrease the risk of single-node attacks. The SG-PBFT consensus algorithm improves the traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm by optimizing the PBFT consensus process and using a score grouping mechanism to achieve a higher consensus efficiency. The experimental results show that the method can greatly improve the consistency efficiency and effectively prevent single-node attacks. Specifically, when the number of consensus nodes reaches 1000, the consensus time of our algorithm is only about 27% of what is required for the state-of-the-art PBFT consensus algorithm.

Intrusion detection, as one of the important technologies to ensure network security, has been widely studied. However, class imbalance leads to a challenging problem, that is, the normal data is much more than the attack data. Class imbalance will lead to the deviation of decision boundary, which makes higher value attack data classification error. In the face of imbalanced data, how to make the classification model classify more effectively is called imbalanced learning problem. In this study, we propose a tabular data sampling method to solve the imbalanced learning problem, which aims to balance the normal samples and attack samples. Firstly, for normal samples, on the premise of minimizing the loss of sample information, the K-nearest neighbor method is used for effective undersampling. Then, we design a tabular auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks model (TACGAN) for attack sample oversampling. TACGAN model is an extension of ACGAN model. We add two loss functions in the generator to measure the information loss between real data and generated data, which makes TACGAN more suitable for the generation of tabular data. Finally, the normal data after undersampling and the attack data after oversampling are mixed to balance the data. We have carried out verification experiments on three real intrusion detection data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves excellent results in Accuracy, F1, AUC and Recall. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Class imbalance; Generative adversarial network; Intrusion detection; K-nearest neighbor; TACGAN","Classification (of information); Computer crime; Generative adversarial networks; Motion compensation; Nearest neighbor search; Network security; Text processing; Class imbalance; Data classification; Imbalanced data; Imbalanced Learning; Intrusion-Detection; K-near neighbor; Learning problem; Nearest-neighbour; Network models; Tabular auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network model; Intrusion detection",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124481928

The majority of existing research works rely on a unique third-party auditor (TPA) or fixed TPAs to audit the integrity of outsourced data, and thus they are vulnerable to DoS and collusion attacks as the TPA is not completely trusted. To conquer this problem, a blockchain-based random auditor committee is proposed to replace the fixed TPAs for the integrity verification (call BRAC scheme for short). The proposed blockchain consensus algorithm utilizes a verifiable random function (VRF) to select the third-party auditor committee (TPAC) which performs contract verification. The leader of TPAs (LTPA) packs the verification proof into a blockchain called verification chain. The main idea is employing the output of a VRF for leader election to make it probabilistic, such that specific nodes cannot be targeted in advance and a certain fraction of the nodes being malicious can be tolerated.

Those algorithms have also been used in communication technologies to improve the system performance in terms of frequency spectrum usage, latency, and security. With the rapid developments of ML techniques, especially deep learning (DL), it is critical to consider the security concern when applying the algorithms. While ML algorithms offer significant advantages for 6G networks, security concerns on artificial intelligence (AI) models are typically ignored by the scientific community so far.

Sensitive data are collected and aggregated in a privacy-preserving approach using current Internet of Things (IoT) technology, leading to immense challenge and consequent interest in developing secure computing algorithms for individual and organizational data. However, most existing solutions focus on specific evaluations (e.g., SUM), and they use heavy cryptographic techniques, which are far from practice for constrained IoT devices. The Trusted Execution Environment (TEE, implemented with Intel SGX) can assist in computing arbitrary functions and avoiding resource-consuming operations. Nevertheless, TEE is subject to several challenges because TEE is vulnerable to limited resource and even function violations, e.g., the attacker may bypass the boundary of TEE. In this paper, we propose a lightweight non-interactive privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme for resource-constrained devices, named PANDA, where TEE is introduced to bypass the trusted entities requirement and heavy overhead. Additionally, PANDA explores the certificate-aided function authorization to prevent leakage from unauthorized functions, and designs the public verifiable certificate management to detect the abnormal behaviors of the host to mitigate the external host compromise. We formalize PANDA with rigorous security analysis to indicate privacy protection against the compromised aggregator and analyst.

Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technology utilizes 5G and has the potential to improve the safety and efficiency of the transportation system by allowing vehicles to communicate with one another and automating certain driving features. However, it is important to consider the risks that 5G brings, including cybersecurity risks, and how attacks through the 5G network can disrupt a traffic network that includes C-V2X technology. This paper presents a method to characterize the effects of several risk scenarios. Compared to prior qualitative risk assessments, outcomes include quantitative indicators measuring system safety and performance for analysis. The approach enables a more detailed and rigorous assessment of interdependent systems risks between the telecommunications and transportation networks than previously possible, particularly in the transition to 5G. A range of potential risk scenarios are assessed. The results show that cyberattacks that alter the behavior of vehicles cause delays across the entire network, cascading across the system and affecting more than just the vehicles directly targeted. The simulations show different levels of traffic delays and numbers of collisions for each risk scenario, indicating that the effects of a cyberattack can differ widely depending on the specifics of the attack. The simulation is easily adaptable to the location, C-V2X features, and risk scenarios of interest.

An external eavesdropper (Eve) tries to eavesdrop the information from the cooperative channel. Since VLC is mainly available for line-of-sight path, and the UEs and Eve under the worktable cannot directly receive signals from the optical access point, a device is naturally employed to perform optical–electrical conversion and RF transmission. Further the device and RIS are jointly employed to eliminate blind spots and extend communication coverage. With these settings, the statistical characteristics of the VLC link and RF link are determined based on the feature of the optical channel and the RIS-aided wireless channel, respectively. The close-form expression of the secrecy outage probability for the proposed RIS-aided heterogeneous VLC–RF cooperative NOMA network is derived.

These online systems can utilize Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to ensure their trustworthiness by preventing cyber security threats. Hence it has become necessary for any system to design advanced and intelligent IDS models. However, most existing IDS models are based on traditional machine learning algorithms with weak, shallow learning behaviours providing less efficient feature selection and classification performance of new attacks. Another problem is that these approaches are either Network-based or Host-based intrusion detection and it often leads to many known attacks being unrecognized by the detection module. Additionally, they lack flexible and scalable handling of the massive amounts of network traffic data due to high model complexity. To overcome these issues, an efficient hybrid IDS model is presented which is built using MapReduce based Black Widow Optimized Convolutional-Long Short-Term Memory (BWO-CONV-LSTM) network. The first stage of this IDS model is the feature selection by the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. The second stage is the hybrid deep learning classifier model of BWO-CONV-LSTM on a MapReduce framework for intrusion detection from the system traffic data. The proposed BWO-CONV-LSTM network is the combination of Convolutional and LSTM neural networks whose hyper-parameters are optimized by BWO to obtain the ideal architecture. Performance evaluations of the BWO-CONV-LSTM based IDS model are performed over the NSL-KDD, ISCX-IDS, UNSW-NB15, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets. The results indicate that the proposed BWO-CONV-LSTM model has high intrusion detection performance with 98.67%, 97.003%, 98.667% and 98.25% accuracy for NSL-KDD, ISCX-IDS, UNSW-NB15, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets respectively, with fewer false values, less computation time and better classification coefficients. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Black Widow Optimization; Convolutional-Long Short-Term memory; CSE-CIC-IDS2018; Deep Learning; Hyper-Parameter Optimization; Intrusion Detection Systems; ISCX-IDS; NSL-KDD; UNSW-NB15","Brain; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Long short-term memory; Network security; Optimization; Black widow optimization; Convolutional-long short-term memory; CSE-CIC-ids2018; Deep learning; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Intrusion Detection Systems; ISCX-intrusion detection system; NSL-KDD; Optimisations; UNSW-nb15; Convolution",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123678926

Malware has become more complex in its intent and capabilities over time, which has prompted the need for constant improvement in detection and defence methods. Of particular concern are the anti-analysis obfuscation techniques, such as packing and encryption, that are employed by malware developers to evade detection and thwart the analysis process. In such cases, malware is generally impervious to basic analysis methods and so analysts must use more invasive techniques to extract signatures for classification, which are inevitably not scalable due to their complexity. In this article, we present a hybrid framework for malware classification designed to overcome the challenges incurred by current approaches. The framework incorporates novel static and dynamic malware analysis methods, where static malware executables and dynamic process memory dumps are converted to images mapped through space-filling curves, from which visual features are extracted for classification. The framework is less invasive than traditional analysis methods in that there is no reverse engineering required, nor does it suffer from the obfuscation limitations of static analysis. On a dataset of 13,599 obfuscated and non-obfuscated malware samples from 23 families, the framework outperformed both static and dynamic standalone methods with precision, recall and accuracy scores of 97.6%, 97.6% and 97.6% respectively. © 2022 The Author(s)","Computer vision; Image processing; Malware classification; Space-filling curves","Computer vision; Filling; Malware; Network security; Reverse engineering; Static analysis; Analysis method; Code developers; Constant improvement; Hybrid framework; Image-based; Images processing; Malicious codes; Malware classifications; Space-filling curve; Statics and dynamics; Cryptography",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124980278

This process is very complex and inefficient in terms of time and resources. Moreover, the exercise infrastructure created in current cyber ranges does not reflect the dynamic environment of real-world systems and does not provide adaptability for changing requirements. To tackle these issues, we developed a system that can automate many tasks of the cybersecurity exercise life cycle.

The array of identity frauds and cyber-attacks have also jeopardized the security countermeasures of biometric authentication systems. In this paper, an improved feature descriptor named Distinctively Encoded Histogram of Fingerprint Features (DEHFF) is proposed for live fingerprint detection. The DEHFF incorporates the two fundamental features i.e., ridge-valley contrast (ridge contours) and phase (ridge orientation) of fingerprints for liveness detection. The perceived response balances the abrupt intensity variations in the initial pixel information. Further, the Gabor filters are used to extract ridge contour information in the transform domain. Moreover, the objective function based on the Twin Confidence Value is proposed for linear integration of ridge contours extracted by Gabor and perceived spatial stimuli. The Local Phase Quantization utilizing the Point-wise Covariance of Gradients (PCG-LPQri) is proposed to determine the ridge orientation. Both feature sets are exclusively quantized into pre-defined intervals. The quantized features with relevant weights are then registered into a single feature set and represented through a 2-D histogram.

Our empirical results demonstrate the correctness and the effectiveness of our approach in guaranteeing a Co-Location-Resistant (CLR) VM placement with a specific level of confidence and a threshold error as new incoming VM requests are being assigned to servers online.

Due to the rising number of cyber-attacks that target critical Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), organisations are required to consider such attacks as severe business risks. Therefore, identifying potential cyber threats and analysing their impacts is crucial to business continuity planning. This paper proposes a structured threat modelling approach for ICPS that enables prediction and analysis of cyber risks to protect industrial assets from potential cyber-attacks. The method involves classifying ICPS assets based on criticality, and then analysing the cyber security vulnerabilities, threats, risks, impacts, and countermeasures. The proposed methodology enables end-to-end threat modelling through the development of a new framework that is integrated with VueOne digital twin tool to model and analyse threats throughout ICPS lifecycle, identifying cyber risks and proposing mitigation controls. Moreover, it uses meta-data extracted from VueOne tool to automatically generate the software code and hardware configurations that can be directly deployed on ICPS assets in order to implement the countermeasures, thereby protecting them from these potential cyber-attacks.

This article explores two aspects of security maintenance: a method for prioritizing vulnerability patches, and visualization of the priorities to aid in decision making. State-of-the-art methods rank vulnerabilities by analyzing the connectivity graph or the logical attack graph and present the results in a table form, a view of the organizational network with highlighted failure points, or even the complete attack graph, in either case flooding the human operator with a lot of hardly comprehensible information. We suggest a Network Topology Vulnerability Score (NTVS) which shows preferable results by ranking vulnerabilities in a planning graph — an interim data structure used by planners when analyzing logical attack graphs. We also suggest a new abstracted presentation of the network in order to ease the comprehension of NTVS scores. The principal results obtained on two real networks show that patching vulnerabilities prioritized by NTVS leads to a faster decrease in the number of available attack paths toward the critical assets.

In this study, an improved Coupled Map Lattices model is proposed to address the evolution process of cascading failures on rail transit network. Particularly, the model quantifies important factors of cascading failures integrating quantitative failure spreading mode, anti-risk ability of stations, and perturbation index. The rail transit network vulnerability is then modeled addressing numbers of failed stations, degree of affected passengers, and loss of passenger travel time as a result of cascading failures. The methodology is applied to the metro network of Shanghai, China. Results show that the propagation of network cascading failure depends on the station's anti-risk ability, geographical location, and type of adjacent stations. Stations located in the urban center area are more susceptible to failures of adjacent stations. Furthermore, higher affected passenger volume and station coupling strength would lead to more serious and rapid spreading of failures, and thus more vulnerable of the metro system. However, the anti-risk ability of stations could effectively resist the spread of failures in the early stage, and stations with higher topology redundancy demonstrate stronger anti-risk ability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-risk ability; Cascading failures; Coupled Map Lattices; Failure spreading mode; Rail transit network vulnerability","Crystal lattices; Light rail transit; Network security; Subways; Topology; Travel time; Uncertainty analysis; Anti-risk ability; Cascading failures; Coupled map lattices; Failure spreading mode; Model networks; Network vulnerability; Rail transit; Rail transit network vulnerability; Transit networks; Urban rail transit; Failure (mechanical)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122742806

Due to the independence between blockchains, it is tough to complete asset exchange tasks between diverse chains. Facing this problem, multiple cross-chain exchange schemes were proposed, but they have not been widely used due to various defects in terms of compatibility, flexibility, security, and practicability. In this paper, we construct a comprehensive cross-chain exchange system called Practical AgentChain. Various coins can be mapped to the corresponding tokens on Practical AgentChain for trading. One or multiple trading operators can spontaneously form a service deposit pool on existing blockchains and register a trading group for profit using the well-designed smart contract called Agent Contract. All the trading groups competitively provide cross-chain exchange services. Clients with exchange currency requirements can freely select an appropriate trading group to request services, such as mapping assets to tokens or withdraw tokens. The choice of the trading group is made according to the group's deposit and the group members’ reputation recorded on the Agent Contract. This system also incorporates Town crier as the reliable Data Oracle system for obtaining the status of cross-chain transactions and combines a matching exchange protocol to ensure the fairness of on-chain token exchange. In addition, we design an impartial service arbitration mechanism and a deposit allocation scheme to ensure the reliability of the system. Through security analysis, our system can resist re-use attacks, denial-of-service attacks and resolve service availability issues. We modify the Town crier adaptively and combine it with Ethereum to implement the simulation. The experimental results show that Practical AgentChain is efficient and low-cost. Besides, our system can be deployed on any existing blockchain that supports smart contracts since the system's architecture is highly portable. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; Cross-chain; Data Oracle; Fair exchange; Smart contract","Commerce; Denial-of-service attack; Deposits; Distributed ledger; Network security; Agent contract; Block-chain; Chain exchange; Cross-chain; Data oracle; Decentralised; Exchange protocols; Fair exchange; Group members; Matchings; Smart contract",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122668974

In these environments, often patching is neither automated nor cost-effective, demanding large manual administrative efforts in a timely manner with as much less system downtime as possible. The impact or risk of a vulnerability could depend on the network characteristics, context that defines the vulnerability and circumstances that led to it. Moreover, not all vulnerabilities are always exploited by the attackers; and not all vulnerabilities can be patched due to the resource constraints such as people, infrastructure, tools and time available to patch every vulnerability. Also, ICSs such as SCADA have strict requirements of system uptime and availability. These constraints place significant importance on the patch prioritization of networks and devices, which needs to be strategic and efficient. Addressing this challenge in the prioritization of patches in ICSs, we present SmartPatch a three-step, systematic patch prioritization method to address patch sequencing in an interdependent and complex network. SmartPatch is a seamless integration of system modeling, risk management and game theory. SmartPatch utilizes prior knowledge, learnings and experiences about the system dynamics and identifies an efficient and effective defensive strategy. The framework's output is a patch prioritization strategy that is cost-constrained and reduces the impact of the possible attacks to a large extent. We propose a security metric called the “Residual Impact Score” (RIS) to analyze the impact of all discovered vulnerabilities on the system. We validate the applicability of SmartPatch by considering the case study of an interdependent, complex SCADA chain in the smart grid system using the IEEE 5-Bus system.

Considering the impacts of false data injection (FDI) attacks on the conventional consensus algorithms, a hybrid solution is presented based on the combination of multiobjective sliding-mode control and communication link quality observer to provide a reliable performance against different types of FDIs. Unlike the commonly developed distributed observer-based cyber-resilient algorithms, this approach aims to form a complete localized solution without the requirements for transmission of extra distributed signals in the secondary layer. Using the proposed method, the system reliability will not be impacted by the cyber intrusions on the distributed observer terms, and the system's dynamic performance is not deteriorated by the counteracting operation resulted from adaptive distributed observers under other system-transient conditions such as load dynamics, which can be even worsened under communication delays. Using cyber-resilient offset compensation terms, performance of the proposed sliding-mode control scheme is enhanced for multiobjective regulation. Integrating the sliding-mode control with communication link observer also ensures effective isolation of the unbounded and extreme cyberattacks. Unlike the former indirect local observers, the proposed scheme operates directly based on monitoring the affected distributed signals rather than only power terms, which enhances its reliability on detection. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through a real-time model developed in Typhoon HIL-402 real-time simulator as well as the experimental tests. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Consensus distributed control; cyber security; microgrid; sliding-mode control","Computer crime; Cyber attacks; Distributed parameter control systems; Network security; Quality control; Reliability; Sliding mode control; Consensus; Cyber security; Heuristics algorithm; Microgrid; Multi objective; Observer; Regulation; Sliding modes; Sliding-mode control; Heuristic algorithms",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121353466

We then discuss the non-linear nature of the EV charging load and simulate multiple attacks that can be launched against the power grid using these EVs. EV loads have high reactive power demand which can have a larger impact on the grid compared to residential loads. We perform simulations on two power grids and demonstrate that while the grid can recover after a 48 MW attack utilizing traditional residential loads, a smaller 30 MW EV load attack can completely destabilize the system.

With the existence of cyber-attacks, state estimation may become inaccurate, which can eventually lead to wrong supervisory decision making. To detect cyber-attacks in power grids equipped with phasor measurement units (PMUs), a new intrusion detection system based on clustering approach, called PMU Intrusion Detection System (PMUIDS), is proposed in this article. After solving the optimal PMU placement in N-1 contingency, several static state estimations are obtained by removing the measurements of one PMU in each time. The resulting state vectors are clustered in two steps: First, subtractive clustering is employed to obtain the number of clusters, which determines the number of integrity attacks; and second, fuzzy C-means clustering assigns the state vectors to the corresponding clusters, which determines the attacked PMUs. In addition, two theorems are proved, which indicate that the attacker cannot coordinate successful stealth attacks in cases that by removing attacked PMUs from state estimation, the power system still remains full observable. Furthermore, in the case of possible stealth attacks, the attacker cannot falsify the estimation of any arbitrary state variable. The hardware-in-the-loop results on a sample power system show that the proposed approach can detect integrity attacks, determine the number of attacks, obtain the correct state vector, and localize the attacks, even in case of multiple simultaneous attacks. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Attack localization; intrusion detection; measurement correction; PMU network; static state estimation","Crime; Decision making; Electric power transmission networks; Intrusion detection; Network security; Phasor measurement units; State estimation; Attack localization; Clustering approach; Fuzzy C means clustering; Hard-ware-in-the-loop; Intrusion Detection Systems; Measurement corrections; Number of clusters; Subtractive clustering; Computer crime",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107191248

Despite its strong protection for security and privacy, the current Bitcoin blockchain can only support a low number of transactions per second (TPS). Besides the PoW consensus protocol, the other key aspect of Bitcoin that limits TPS is its networking protocol. In this work, we aim at redesigning the current Bitcoin's networking protocol to increase TPS without changing the vital components in its consensus-building protocol. In particular, this work improves the compact-block relaying protocol to enable the propagation of blocks containing a massive number of transactions without inducing extra propagation latencies. The improvements of this work consist of (i) replacing the existing store-and-forward compact-block relaying scheme with a cut-through compact-block relaying scheme; (ii) exploiting rateless erasure codes for P2P networks to increase the block-propagation efficiency. Since the protocols designed in this work only need to rework the current Bitcoin's networking protocol and do not modify the data structures and crypto-functional components, they can be seamlessly incorporated into the existing Bitcoin blockchain. To validate the designs, we perform analysis on the protocols and implement a Bitcoin network simulator on NS3 to run different block propagation protocols.

However, such security-related assumptions can easily fall when considering the exposure of fog nodes’ location, the heterogeneity of device providers, and the ease of misuse and misconfigurations by end-users, to name a few. As a result, compromised fog nodes can stealthily steal sensitive information, such as the devices’ location, path, and private personal attributes. This paper presents PARFAIT, a privacy-preserving, secure, and low-delay framework for securely accessing services in fog-enabled IoT ecosystems. PARFAITguarantees low-delay authentication and authorization to local fog nodes, protecting the identity and the attributes possessed by the IoT devices. Moreover, PARFAITuses rolling ephemeral identities, providing unlinkability among access requests, thus preventing the tracking of mobile IoT devices by multiple compromised fog nodes. We performed several experimental tests on a reference proof-of-concept to show the viability of PARFAIT. Specifically, adopting an elliptic curve with a group size of 512 bits, PARFAITallows the access to a single protected resource in only 0.274 s, and such a delay rises to only 0.359 s with 10 consecutive requests (66.8% less than the quickest competing approach). © 2022 The Author","Edge computing; Fog computing; IoT; Privacy; Security","Authentication; Ecosystems; Edge computing; Fog; Internet of things; Privacy-preserving techniques; Computational capability; Edge computing; Low delay; Misconfigurations; Node location; Privacy; Privacy preserving; Security; Service access; Storage spaces; Fog computing",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123950284

Many companies and digital services are actively migrating their storage and computational needs to the cloud. With such an expansion of virtual services, security threats are also significantly increasing. Utilizing the Attack Representation Methods (ARMs) and Attack Graph (AG) enables the security administrator to understand the cloud network's current security situation. However, the AG suffers from scalability challenges. It relies on the connectivity between the services and the vulnerabilities associated with the services to allow the system administrator to realize its security state. This approach caused the AG to be vast and challenging to generate and analyze. To address the scalability challenges, we propose a segmentation-based scalable security state (S3) framework for the network. Our framework utilizes the well-known divide-and-conquer approach to divide the large network region into smaller, manageable segments. We follow a well-known segmentation approach derived from the K-means clustering algorithm to partition the system into segments based on the similarity between the services. A distributed firewall (DFW) separates the segments to ensure the attacker cannot move laterally and compromise them. Our evaluation shows that the separation of segments not only preserves the original reachability and connectivity but also enhances the scalability of the AG. The presented framework (a) provides a scalable attack graph generation algorithm by reducing attack graph generation time and density, which in turn reduces the complexity of security analysis on an extensive cloud network, (b) ensures a loop-free attack graph through the utilization of cycle detection and removal algorithm, and (c) presents an approach to provide the optimal number of segments based on the cost of implementing the segmentation using the distributed firewall rules. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Attack graphs; Distributed firewall (DFW); Microsegmentation; Security analysis; Segmentation optimization; Software-defined network (SDN)","Graphic methods; K-means clustering; Network security; Optimization; Security systems; Software defined networking; Attack graph; Cloud networks; Distributed firewall; Microsegmentation; Optimisations; Security analysis; Segmentation optimization; Software-defined network; Software-defined networks; Scalability",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123921376

Malware has continuously evolved, becoming more sophisticated and evasive, and thus it remains a major cyber-security threat. To keep pace with malware's evolution, there is a critical need to develop new, advanced malware detection methods. Widely-used solutions, such as antivirus software and other static host-based intrusion detection systems, have limitations, particularly in detecting new, unknown, and evasive malware. Many of the limitations of static analysis can be overcome when dynamic malware analysis is leveraged by machine learning (ML) algorithms by executing the malware in an isolated environment (e.g., sandbox), which enables the acquisition of rich behavioral and time-oriented information associated with malware behavior. Prior studies have proposed various detection methods based on dynamically extracted API calls for malware detection, but other than simple order-based approaches, the use of more advanced time-based methods has not been explored. In this paper, we propose a more comprehensive detection framework which, by analyzing the raw multivariate time-series data associated with malware execution, can accurately capture malware behavior and provide clear explainability regarding malware behavior and detection model decisions. We are the first to mine and automatically discover meaningful and explainable time-interval temporal API call patterns associated with malware behavior and leverage them, using a variety of ML algorithms, for malware detection and categorization. To evaluate our proposed solution, we established a comprehensive dynamic-analysis environment using Cuckoo Sandbox and analyzed more than 17,000 portable executables executed in Windows 10, the most widely-used operating system today. We conducted extensive experiments on malware detection and categorization and compared the performance of our solution to state-of-the-art methods, including non-time-oriented (classic ML algorithms) and order-based methods (LSTM networks). The results show that our proposed solution outperforms the other methods, obtaining 99.6% detection accuracy for unknown malware and 97.65% categorization accuracy. In a more complex scenario of detecting an unknown malware type with unseen modus operandi, our method obtained almost 90% detection accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. To demonstrate our ability to provide human explainability, we present some temporal patterns of different malware families that we discovered which shed light on malware behavior that can be used by cyber-security experts to better understand malware, better defend against future attacks, and even attribute malware campaigns to the cyber-attackers launching them. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Detection; Machine learning; Malware; Time interval; Time series","Cybersecurity; Intrusion detection; Long short-term memory; Malware; Network security; Static analysis; Windows operating system; API calls; Cyber security; Detection; Detection methods; Machine learning algorithms; Malware behaviors; Malware detection; Temporal pattern; Time interval; Times series; Time series",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124178934

They are not merely tools, but have also become advanced instruments with network connectivity. Connectivity is necessary to accept software updates, accept instructions, and transfer sensory data, but it also exposes the robot to cyberattacks, which can damage the patient or the surgeon. These injuries are normally caused by safety failures, as seen in accidents with industrial robots, but cyberattacks are caused by security failures instead. We create a taxonomy for both types of failures in this paper specifically for surgical robots. These robots are increasingly sold and used in the European Union (EU), hence it is natural to consider how surgical robots are viewed and treated by EU law. Specifically, which rights regulators and manufacturers have under it, and which legal remedies and actions a patient or manufacturer would have in a single national legal system in the union, if injuries were to occur from a security failure caused by an adversary that cannot be unambiguously identified (attribution of cyberattacks is often hard). Given that the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) has only recently entered into force, we also offer some general considerations of the regulation. We find that the selected (Danish) national legal system can adequately deal with attacks on surgical robots, because it can on one hand efficiently compensate the patient, and at the same time protect the patient by not shying away from dealing with the problem concretely. This is because of its flexibility; secondly, a remarkable absence of distinction between safety vs security causes of failure and focusing instead on the detrimental effects, thus benefiting the patient; and third, liability can be removed from the manufacturer by withdrawing its status as party, if the patient chooses a separate public law measure to recover damages. Furthermore, we find that current EU law does consider both security and safety aspects of surgical robots, without it mentioning it through literal wording, but it also adds substantial liabilities and responsibilities to the manufacturers of surgical robots, gives the patient special rights and confers immense powers on the regulators, which can end up affecting any future lawsuits. © 2022 Kaspar Rosager Ludvigsen","Civil litigation; Cyberphysical systems; Cybersecurity; Danish law; EU law; Healthcare law; Product liability; Surgical robots","Accidents; Cybersecurity; Industrial robots; Manufacture; Product liability; Robotic surgery; Surgical equipment; Civil litigation; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-physical systems; Danish law; European Union Law; Healthcare law; Legal system; Network connectivity; Security failure; Accident prevention",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125144444

Given that national and global economies depend upon efficient supply chains, port stakeholders must develop security plans to respond to all hazards, natural and manmade. Given recent cyber-attacks affecting shipping ports, along with the multi-billion dollar cyber insurance gap, ports need to understand the tradeoffs between increased competitiveness and higher risk through investment in automation and advanced logistics technologies. This article addresses the need to understand the economic impact of cyber-attacks that affect shipping port operations and thereby enable risk assessments that holistically evaluate interactions among port Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems. Using a Nearly-Orthogonal Latin Hypercube (NOLH) experimental design, we construct transportation disruption profiles based on actual cyber-attacks that specify the range of operational effects of IT/OT dependencies on stakeholder transportation assets. To capture the costs of the physical disruption, we extend Boland et al's Dynamic Discretization Discovery (DDD) algorithm to capture capacity constraints and enable delay modeling to accommodate commodities arriving late due to disruption. Economic loss functions for seven commodity categories based on the willingness to pay literature are used to compute delay costs so that stakeholders can estimate the range of economic and operational impacts within a disruption profile.

Moving target defense (MTD) techniques such as instruction set randomization (ISR), address space randomization (ASR), and data space randomization (DSR) can be used to protect systems against such attacks. CPS often use time-triggered architectures to guarantee predictable and reliable operation. MTD techniques can cause time delays with unpredictable behavior. To protect CPS against memory corruption attacks, MTD techniques can be implemented in a mixed time and event-triggered architecture that provides capabilities for maintaining safety and availability during an attack. This paper presents a mixed time and event-triggered MTD security approach based on the ARINC 653 architecture that provides predictable and reliable operation during normal operation and rapid detection and reconfiguration upon detection of attacks. We leverage a hardware-in-the-loop testbed and an advanced emergency braking system (AEBS) case study to show the effectiveness of our approach. © 2022","Cyber–physical systems; Event triggered; Moving target defense; Time triggered","Codes (symbols); Crime; Cybersecurity; Memory architecture; Random processes; Safety engineering; Code injection; Code reuse; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Defense techniques; Event-triggered; Memory corruption attacks; Moving target defense; Reliable operation; Time triggered; Network security",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124562282

These hostile operating environments combined with the UAVs reliance on wireless protocols produces an increased threat level. Many attacks against the UAV are becoming commonplace as they are simple to conduct with inexpensive hardware, such as spoofing and jamming. Unfortunately, as many of these vulnerabilities exist within underlying technologies, securing the UAV becomes a difficult task. A promising approach to identifying and mitigating these attacks is the development of an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS). The proposed approach uses principal component analysis (PCA) and one-class classifiers to detect attacks. This allows for the use of flight logs for training data, providing a versatile and ubiquitous approach. The proposed detection method is integrated into a fully developed IDS called MAVIDS. This IDS operates onboard the UAV within a resource-constrained agent device, allowing it to detect and potentially mitigate attacks even when communication to the ground control station is lost from jamming. The approach shows to be effective against GPS spoofing and jamming with macro averaged F1 scores of 90.57% and 94.3% respectively. © 2022","Cyber–physical systems; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Novelty detection; Unmanned aerial vehicles","Antennas; Computer crime; Intrusion detection; Jamming; Machine learning; Military vehicles; Network security; Principal component analysis; Rock mechanics; Critical operations; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Industrial controls; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion-Detection; Novelty detection; Operating environment; Threat levels; Wireless protocol; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124555274

Therefore, there is a need to find a sufficient countermeasure mechanism to detect image forgeries. This paper presents a new CMFD approach that depends on deep learning for IoT based smart cities.

However, smart satellite networks attract the attention of hackers, resulting in them being targeted by severe cyber-attacks that can compromise their integrity, affect their availability, or breach the confidentiality of the data they generate, collect or rout. Lately, several prominent cyber-attacking scenarios have been observed to target IoT-enabled systems, resulting in loss, alteration, or exfiltration of data, disabling of devices, (distributed) denial of services, the formation of botnets, and lateral movement into otherwise secured networks.

In many cases, it is critical not only to detect individual malicious connections, but to detect which node in a network has generated malicious traffic so that appropriate actions can be taken to reduce the threat and increase the system's cybersecurity. Instead of analysing connections only, node behavioural analysis can be performed by exploiting the graph information encoded in a connection network. Network traffic, however, is temporal data and extracting graph information without a fixed time scope may only unveil macro-dynamics that are less related to cybersecurity threats. To address these issues, a threefold approach is proposed here: firstly, temporal dissection for extracting graph-based information is applied. As the resulting graphs are typically affected by class imbalance (i.e. malicious nodes are under-represented), two novel graph data-level preprocessing techniques - R-hybrid and SM-hybrid - are introduced, which focus on exploiting the most relevant graph substructures. Finally, a Neural Network (NN) and two Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) approaches are compared when performing node behaviour classification. Furthermore, we compare the node classification performance of these supervised models with traditional unsupervised anomaly detection techniques. Results show that temporal dissection parameters affected classification performance, while the data-level preprocessing strategies reduced class imbalance and led to improved supervised node behaviour classification, outperforming anomaly detection models. In particular, Neural Network (NN) outperformed Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) approaches for two attack families and was less affected by class imbalance, yet one GCN performed best overall. The presented study successfully applies a temporal graph-based approach for malicious actor detection in network traffic data. © 2022 The Author(s)","Deep Learning; Graph Convolutional Networks; Graph imbalance problem; Network analysis; Temporal dissection","Anomaly detection; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Cybersecurity; Data mining; Deep learning; Graph theory; Behaviour classification; Convolutional networks; Cyber security; Data level; Deep learning; Graph convolutional network; Graph imbalance problem; Graph-based; Imbalance problem; Temporal dissection; Graphic methods",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124024189

However, EU's significant regulatory activity is faced with substantial difficulties. While cybersecurity concerns are placed high on the list of issues that worry Europeans making a regulatory response pressing, the cybersecurity theoretical framework is far from concluded: Difficulties start as early as when attempting to define the term, ultimately divulging a lack of common understanding. Different actors understand cybersecurity differently under different circumstances. A distinction that could perhaps prove useful in creating clarity as to its exact meaning would distinguish between cybersecurity as praxis and cybersecurity as a state. Cybersecurity as praxis would then be understood as the activities and measures that need to be undertaken in order to accomplish cybersecurity's aims and objectives. Accordingly, cybersecurity as a state would mean the condition that is achieved once cybersecurity as praxis has succeeded; Within cybersecurity as a state persons need to be protected against any cyber threat. A distinction between cybersecurity as praxis and cybersecurity as a state would not only be useful in delineating the term's content but could also constitute the necessary theoretical groundwork for development, ultimately, of a new right to cybersecurity. EU law has already taken positive steps towards acknowledgement of a new right to cybersecurity. However, a lot more needs to be done; Past progress needs to be continued and updated. A conceivable next step could take the form of formal acknowledgement of such a new right in EU law, in a future amendment of the Act's provisions or otherwise. © 2022 Vagelis Papakonstantinou",,"Administrative structures; Condition; Cyber security; Cyber threats; National laws; Pressung; Support policy; Theoretical framework; Cybersecurity",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123733597

Traditional malware detection techniques require a lot of human intervention and resources (in terms of time and storage) as these involve manual analysis of all malware files in the application. Moreover, malware authors have developed techniques like polymorphism and code obfuscation that evade the traditional signature-based detection approaches employed by anti-virus companies. To solve this issue, malware detection enabled by deep learning (DL) methods is being used recently. This paper presents a performance comparison of 26 state-of-the-art pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models in Android malware detection. It also includes performance obtained by large-scale learning with SVM and RF classifiers and stacking with CNN models. Based on the results, an EfficientNet-B4 CNN-based model is proposed to detect Android malware using image-based malware representations of the Android DEX file. EfficientNet-B4 extracts relevant features from the malware images. These features are then passed through a global average pooling layer and fed into a softmax classifier. The proposed method obtained an accuracy of 95.7% in the binary classification of Android malware images, outperforming the compared models in all performance metrics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Android; Convolutional neural network; Cybercrime; Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Malware detection","Android (operating system); Computer viruses; Convolution; Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Mobile security; Network security; Support vector machines; Viruses; Android; Android malware; Convolutional neural network; Cyber security; Cyber-crimes; Deep learning; Hot topics; Malware detection; Network-based; Neural network model; Convolutional neural networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123705885

In addition, attackers can send large numbers of authentication and data access requests to spread malware across the smart communities’ network and cause Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This paper proposes SPrivAD, a secure and privacy-preserving mutually dependent authentication and data access solution by which smart communities’ assets such as users, devices, and apps can authenticate each other before allowing data access. SPrivAD uses an Inter-Attribute-based Zero Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (IA-ZKPK) protocol based on computational attributes of cryptographic operations, and cryptographic identities of the assets to perform Mutually Dependent Multi-Factor Authentication and Data Access (MDMFA). The computational attributes such as message size and number of executed steps of cryptographic operations are features derived from the knowledge of cryptographic operations between the assets. Our approach for deriving a unique, deactivatable, and revocable cryptographic identity is based on the secrets of an asset in a modified Elliptic Curve Pedersen Commitment Scheme (EC-PCS) with security and privacy guarantees. We implement a prototype of SPrivAD and evaluate it with respect to its security, privacy, and performance. The results show that it is secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient for mutually dependent authentication and data access in smart communities. Furthermore, we design and analyse a new attack, Smart Communities Authentication Bypass Attack (SCABA), on real-world authentication and secure access schemes such as Ruckus Cloudpath Enrollment System and Duo Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This type of attack exploits valid credentials of smart communities’ assets. We show that SPrivAD mitigates SCABA. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Authentication; Data access; Privacy; Security; Smart communities","Authentication; Malware; Network security; Privacy-preserving techniques; Smart city; Access schemes; Authentication bypass; Cryptographic operations; CryptoGraphics; Data access; Multi-factor authentication; Privacy; Privacy preserving; Security; Smart community; Denial-of-service attack",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123620168

The IoT-enabled edge-computing paradigm provides ubiquitous computing and resource access for the robots for robust services. The interactive sessions and partial computations of the robots result in unnecessary exploitation of real-time resources. This paper introduces a swarm intelligence-based modular interactive computation scheme (MICS) for IoT-assisted robots to address the incompleteness in resource utilization and reduce computational complexity. In this scheme, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is incorporated with intelligent decision-making. The role of swarm intelligence is to improve interactive computations using different agents that provide offloading support. The flexible sharing of swarm agents provides shared resource utilization and comprehensive calculations for robot-based assistance. The proposed scheme performs computing and interaction decisions based on the robot inputs and its parallel processing feature. The proposed scheme's performance is verified using the metrics interaction span, decision complexity, offloading ratio, computing time, and outages. The proposed scheme achieves a 12.74% high interaction span, 6.68% less decision complexity, 11.69% less offloading ratio, and 19.41% less computing time under different intervals. Based on the resource availability analysis, MICS achieves 62.1% compared to IoT-IF 25.6%, SF-EM 32.9, and 25.61%.

The objective of the proposed model is to minimize the total planning cost of multi-carrier microgrids, which incorporates the investment and replacement costs of distributed energy resources, operation and maintenance costs, peak demand charges, emission costs, unserved energy costs, and potential reinforcement costs to handle cyber-physical attacks. Not only is the proposed multi-carrier microgrid planning approach able to determine the optimal size of multi-carrier microgrids, but it also identifies and reinforces the system to handle cyber-physical attacks by serving critical loads. The proposed multi-carrier microgrid planning model is formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem and solved using the GAMS 24.1 software. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated resource planning model, it is applied to a real-world industrial park test-case system.

In this paper, an integrated data-driven defense scheme is proposed, which can sensitively detect data integrity attacks such as false data injection (FDI) attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and replay attacks, and ensures secure transmission against eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, a novel deep learning model is designed so that both the online detection task and the encryption/decryption task can be completed under the same framework. The main idea is inspired by denoising auto-encoders whereas necessary changes are made to adapt to the challenges in the context of CPS attacks, and in light of this, the proposed approach is called modified denoising auto-encoder (MDAE). Unlike supervised classifier-based detectors, the proposed detector can retain sensitivity to unknown attacks because it is trained to learn the normal operation behavior. Moreover, to improve the detectability of the DoS and replay attacks on all data, the check code is designed. Encrypting the transmitted data through nonlinear mapping is achieved using the same MDAE, which prevents the attackers from recording useful information. Benefiting from the fact that the dimension of the variables is reduced after encryption, the transmission traffic can be saved.

Ineffective cybersecurity measures pose serious threats and risks to the development and stability of information societies in the world. Various doctrines and thesis explore how this domain should be treated by the public and private stakeholders. One of these doctrines is cybersecurity as a public good. In this paper, we highlight divergent views about the type of cybersecurity as an economic good. Then, the paper proposes an agent-based simulation model of a repeated public goods game among a set of defenders that are in an uncertain environment with incomplete and imperfect information. In the model, defenders have a probability to choose contribution or being a free-rider, depending on their own preferences and facing with revealed preferences of other defenders. This model implements a utility maximization that applies to each individual, modeling the existence of free-riders, punishments, and interdependency of decisions under a polycentric governance structure. The results of this simulation model show that, over time, defenders update their preferences in reaction to the behavior of other defenders and the experience of cyber-attacks. They indicate a high level of contribution to the provision of cybersecurity as a public good and the effectiveness of decentralized punishment on increasing the contributions. The consistency of the pattern of our results across different empirical studies lends us some reassurance that our model behavior is in quantitative agreement with empirical macro-structures. Furthermore, implementation of a polycentric structure challenges all the relevant agents to take action, and provides more robust environment. © 2022 The Authors","Agent-based modeling; Collective actions; Cybersecurity economics; Heterogeneous preferences; Polycentric governance structure; Public goods; Social preferences","Computational methods; Cybersecurity; Network security; Risk assessment; Simulation platform; Agent-based model; Collective action; Cyber security; Cybersecurity economic; Free-riders; Governance structures; Heterogeneous preference; Polycentric governance structure; Public goods; Social preference; Autonomous agents",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123212303

Correspondingly, armored malware adopts various anti-sandbox techniques to evade analysis, from simple environment-specific traits detection to complex real-user operation environment verification. Particularly, malware may identify sandbox environments by checking several system artifacts that are impacted by the accumulation of normal user activities, such as file accesses. It remains a challenge to defeat this type of anti-sandbox technique. In this paper, we design an emulation-based system called UBER to enhance malware analysis sandboxes. The core idea is to generate realistic system artifacts based on automatically derived user profile models. We solve two major challenges. First, we generate authentic system artifacts continuously to emulate the real-user behaviors. Second, we integrate the generated artifacts stealthily to hide the trace of the emulation. We implement a system prototype using Python system-event monitor and automation control modules. Our experimental results demonstrate that UBER is capable of generating believable system artifacts and effectively mitigates the sandbox evasion techniques that exploit system fingerprinting. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-Sandbox technique; Malware analysis; System artifacts; User behavior emulation; User profiling","Behavioral research; Cybersecurity; Python; User profile; Anti-sandbox technique; Cyber security; File access; Malware analysis; Simple environments; System artifact; User activity; User behavior emulation; User behaviors; User's profiling; Malware",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123029973

An attack detector based on a sliding mode observer (SMO) is used to estimate the state attacks. The parameter values of the SMO-based detector have a significant role in attack detection time and also in attack detection accuracy. An on-time attack detection gives the operator or the automatic attack defender enough time to react efficiently against attacks. Moreover, attacks should be detected accurately in each state variable to be handled well. Hence, a new SMO-based attack detector with parameter adjustment is addressed in this paper using an optimization algorithm. The differential evolutionary algorithm is used to optimize detection time and detection accuracy in the presence of unknown attack vectors and adjust parameters such that attacks are detected correctly and as quickly as possible. The comparison of the simulation results on the IEEE 39-bus test system based on the proposed method and those of other available methods illustrate the capability of the optimized attack detection scheme in terms of detection accuracy and detection time in the presence of unknown attack vectors. © 2021","Adaptive sliding mode observer; Attack detection; Cyber-physical power system; Differential evolutionary algorithm; Optimization; Parameter adjustment","Computer crime; Crime; Cyber attacks; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Network security; Parameter estimation; Adaptive sliding-mode observers; Attack detection; Cybe-physical power system; Cyber physicals; Detection time; Differential evolutionary algorithm; Optimisations; Parameters adjustment; Physical power; Sliding-mode observer; Sliding mode control",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122801553

It is essential and urgent to improve power system resilience, which also substantially impacts the resilience of dependent infrastructures, such as water and health systems. This work investigates the enhancement of power grid resilience using proactive network-constrained economic dispatch (NCED) strategies. An extreme weather event is modeled as an attacker interdicting a selected set of transmission lines to cause overloading of remaining lines, which potentially leads to cascading failures. We define a set of resilience metrics, with the first one being a weighted number of overloaded lines immediately after the attack to capture the potential cascading chain effect, the second one predicting the worst-case value of the first metric to provide a forward-looking evaluation, and the last one assessing whether each line can be overloaded in the worst case to supply more granular awareness. We also propose a defender–attacker–defender NCED model solved by a column-and-constraint generation algorithm to optimize the defined metrics. The model can generate strategies that (1) enhances resilience without additional NCED cost; (2) further enhances resilience with a budgeted extra NCED cost; and (3) achieves a moving target defense scheme shifting the grid's vulnerable part(s). The associated price of resilience is specifically evaluated. Results on standard test systems demonstrate the proposed methods’ effectiveness.

In particular dense WSNs are emerging as an important sensing platforms for the Internet of Things (IoT). WSNs are able to generate huge volumes of raw data, which require network structuring and efficient collaboration between nodes to ensure efficient transmission. In order to reduce the amount of data carried in the network, data aggregation is used in WSNs to define a policy of data fusion and compression. In this paper, we investigate a model for data aggregation in a dense WSN with a single sink. The model divides a circular coverage region centered at the sink into patches which are intersections of sectors of concentric rings, and data in each patch is aggregated at a single node before transmission. Nodes only communicate with other nodes in the same sector. Based on these assumptions, we formulate a linear programming problem to maximize system lifetime by minimizing the maximum proportionate energy consumption over all nodes. Under a wide variety of conditions, the optimal solution employs two transmissions mechanisms: direct transmission, in which nodes send information directly to the sink; and stepwise transmission, in which nodes transmit information to adjacent nodes. An exact formula is given for the proportionate energy consumption rate of the network. Asymptotic forms of this exact solution are also derived, and are verified to agree with the linear programming solution. We investigate three strategies for improving system lifetime: nonuniform energy and information density; iterated compression; and modifications of rings. We conclude that iterated compression brings the greatest increase in system lifetime, but at the cost of possible information loss. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Data aggregation; Data compression; Dense wireless sensor network; Lifetime extension; Linear programming","Data fusion; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Linear programming; Sensor nodes; Data aggregation; Dense wireless sensor network; Environmental conditions; Lifetime extension; Linear-programming; Network efficient; Network structuring; Optimisations; Sensing platforms; System lifetimes; Data compression",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122507464

This paper addresses the analysis of logs emitted by computer systems with a focus on anomaly detection.

Scores collected under normative operations are used to train a semi-supervised deep autoencoder, which serves as a baseline to classify future scores. The approach is not constrained by the structure of underlying logs and does not need for anomalies at training time. The results obtained in detecting anomalies of two industrial systems and the public BG/L and Hadoop datasets widely used as benchmarks, indicate that the recall of AutoLog ranges between 0.96 and 0.99, while the precision is within 0.93 and 0.98.

The integration of cyber components enhances a physical system's capabilities by incorporating intelligence into objects and services. On the other hand, these systems are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks than traditional hard-wired electro-mechanical systems and infrastructure as they are accessible through the Internet. Most of such systems are safety–critical, where successful attacks may result in catastrophic situations by disturbing a critical system's functionalities. To disrupt the physical process, the attacker should have a deep understanding of operational and control parameters and failure conditions of system components. The attacker first intrudes into the system and subsequently abuses the process parameters to disrupt the physical process. Consideration of these issues is important to evaluate the security of CPS.

However, it is difficult for the traditional DDoS detection methods to balance the relationship between accuracy and efficiency.

First, the information entropy detection mechanism detects suspicious components and ports in coarse granularity. Then, a fine-grained packet-based detection mechanism is executed by the convolutional neural network (CNN) model to distinguish normal traffic from suspicious traffic. Finally, the controller performs the defense strategy to intercept the attack.

In order to fill this importance knowledge gap, this short communication reports results of implementing cipher suites recommended by IEC 62351-4 on IEC 61850 messages. In addition to implementation details, real message exchanges are demonstrated with lab experiments. Finally, changing certificate and message sizes are reported. The results show that cipher suite selection is critical as some suites have 29.67 % smaller certificate size than others. The novelty of this short communication is showing details of IEC 62351 application and relevant changes on message sizes and structures of IEC 61850 MMS messages. There is no similar work or publication showing such procedures and results. © 2021 The Author(s)","IEC 61850; IEC 62351-4; MMS message; Power system communication; Smart grid","Electric power system protection; Electric power transmission networks; Electric substations; Cyber security; IEC 62351-4; Iec-61850; Knowledge gaps; Manufacturing message specification; Manufacturing message specification message; Message exchange; Performance; Performances evaluation; Power system communication; Smart power grids",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120646769

However, it causes privacy risk due to the data exchanges between local devices and untrusted edge servers. The powerful analytical capability of AI further exacerbates the risks because it can even infer private information from insensitive data. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving IoT streaming data analytical framework based on edge computing, called PrivStream, to prevent the untrusted edge server from making sensitive inferences from the IoT streaming data. It utilizes a well-designed deep learning model to filter the sensitive information and combines with differential privacy to protect against the untrusted edge server. The noise is also injected into the framework in the training phase to increase the robustness of PrivStream to differential privacy noise. Taking into account the dynamic and real-time characteristics of streaming data, we realize PrivStream with two types of models to process data segment with fixed length and variable length, respectively, and implement it on a distributed streaming platform to achieve real-time streaming data transmission. We theoretically prove that Privstream satisfies ε-differential privacy and experimentally demonstrate that PrivStream has better performance than the state-of-the-art and has acceptable computation and storage overheads. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Differential privacy; Edge computing; Feature extraction; IoT streaming data","Deep learning; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Fixed platforms; Internet of things; Privacy-preserving techniques; Differential privacies; Edge computing; Edge server; Features extraction; Intelligent applications; IoT streaming data; Privacy preserving; Privacy risks; Private information; Streaming data; Edge computing",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120374700

As a result, having access to accurate state estimates, even in the presence of attacks on sensor measurements, is of critical importance. In this work, we analyze performance of resilient state estimators (RSEs) when any subset of sensors may be compromised by a stealthy attacker. Specifically, we consider systems with the well-known l0-based RSE and two commonly used sound intrusion detectors (IDs). For linear time-invariant plants with bounded noise, we define the notion of perfect attackability (PA) when attacks may result in unbounded estimation errors while remaining undetected by the employed ID (i.e., stealthy). We derive necessary and sufficient PA conditions, showing that a system can be perfectly attackable even if the plant is stable. While PA can be prevented with the use the standard cryptographic mechanisms (e.g., message authentication) that ensure data integrity under network-based attacks, their continuous use imposes significant communication and computational overhead. Consequently, we also study the impact that even intermittent use of data authentication has on RSE performance guarantees in the presence of stealthy attacks. We show that if messages from some of the sensors are even intermittently authenticated, stealthy attacks could not result in unbounded state estimation errors. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Attack-resilient state estimation; Cyber–physical systems; Perfect attackability; Security of control systems","Authentication; Computer crime; Cyber attacks; Network security; Attack-resilient state estimation; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Data authentication; Estimation errors; Intrusion detectors; Network-based attacks; Perfect attackability; Security of control system; State Estimators; State estimation",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119444182

Due to limited resources with weak security protection, the IIoT devices can be easily compromised to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, resulting in catastrophic results. Although there are many DDoS mitigations of traditional static schemes, the proactive defense method to resist attacks has not been well studied. Furthermore, existing proactive schemes ignored the delay-sensitive characteristic of applications under the IIoT environments. To address these issues, we first adopt two kinds of moving target defense (MTD) techniques that dynamically control the admission of devices and migrate service replicas to isolate attackers on limited edge clouds and mitigate DDoS attacks early near its source. Then, we formulate a multistage optimization problem of MTD mechanisms deployment and model it as constrained Markov decision processes in order to maximize the available resources of the system under the limitations of the IIoT environments. Besides, we present an MTD optimal strategy algorithm to solve decision problems in a cost-effective manner.

Recently, the attackers have started to use ransom software (ransomware) as an effective method of cyberattack because of their profitability. Ransomware infiltrate victim systems in various ways, usually encrypt files in the system, and demand a ransom to allow user access to the encrypted files again. Although security mechanisms such as firewalls, anti-virus programs, and automated analysis programs have been developed to combat this threat, these mechanisms have little success and fail to protect the valuable assets stored in local or cloud storage resources. In this study, an effective detection and analysis method against ransomware was proposed, and the proposed method was discussed in detail with a case study. As a result of the study, potential information about the attacker were found to be accessible through characteristic behavior analysis of the onion ransomware, which was analyzed in accordance with the proposed method.

Particularly, an UASN deployed in military applications could be invaded by some underwater spy-robots which act as eavesdroppers or hackers. An UASN is confronted with two typical security threats: the eavesdroppers move around the anchored nodes and eavesdrop on the communication channels silently, and the data messages disseminated from the anchored nodes are probably stolen by these eavesdroppers; the hackers disguise themselves and propagate the viruses to infect the anchored nodes in a cascading manner. To reduce the theft probability of data messages and the number of cascading failures (the number of infected nodes) while maintaining the required topology connectivity, an analysis framework is first formulated to investigate the relations between the entropies of degree distributions and the resistances of security threats, and then the entropies of degree distributions are optimized to resist the security threats through appropriately coordinating the communication ranges of anchored nodes. We propose a Topology Control Strategy based on Entropy Optimization (TCSEO). In TCSEO, each anchored node independently sets the initial communication range according to a binomial distribution, and then the communications ranges of anchored nodes are checked and adjusted to maintain the required topology connectivity. Simulation results demonstrate the preferable performance of TCSEO, i.e. TCSEO can reduce the theft probability of data messages and the number of infected nodes effectively, while the required topology connectivity is maintained as much as possible. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cascading failure; Data theft; Entropy optimization; Topology control; Underwater acoustic sensor network","Computer viruses; Crime; Entropy; Military applications; Network security; Personal computing; Probability distributions; Sensor networks; Topology; Viruses; Cascading failures; Communication range; Control strategies; Data messages; Data thefts; Degree distributions; Entropy optimization; Security threats; Topology control; Underwater acoustic sensor networks; Security systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123027591

In particular, the disaster takes the form of a randomly placed disk in a plane. The research aims to find out disaster locations that can cause significant damage to network performance, i.e., vulnerable areas of the network. The topology of vulnerable areas can be redesigned to improve the network's disaster survivability. Moreover, only a few special cases need to be judged for the sake of achieving the aim despite disasters occur randomly across the plane. Another primary contribution is our attempt to construct a proper network topology by using clusters as units.

A huge number of techniques have been proposed and implemented to improve the performance and accuracy of intrusion detection models. In recent years, efforts have been made to keep the attack surface as small as possible. However, the attack vectors have evolved in terms of complexity and diversity, and various intelligent techniques have been employed by the adversaries to exploit the ecosystems. This exploitation can either make the whole system dysfunctional or may lead to important information leakage. More specifically, with the evolution of Internet of Things (IoT), more heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices are interconnecting with each other. These devices have limited processing power and resources, particularly for detecting intrusions. Consequently, Swarm Intelligence (SI) based techniques have received considerable attention, especially in the past decade, as the SI approaches have achieved a decent success rate by optimizing various aspects of an IDS. This paper presents a systematic review with a thorough coverage of articles published between 2010 and 2020 of the state-of-the-art swarm intelligence approaches deployed in various attack surfaces for intrusion detection in various domains. The paper also presents a categorization in accordance with applicability of these SI approaches in improving various aspects of an intrusion detection process. Moreover, the paper also discusses the capabilities and features of various datasets used in experimentation. This aims to help researchers in assessing the capabilities and limitations of SI algorithms to identify security threats and challenges to design and implement an IDS for the detection of cyber attacks in various domains. Moreover, this will also help security individuals in differentiating SI based IDS with traditional ones. As such, the survey would be equally beneficial for the researchers working in the domain of swarm intelligence as well as cybersecurity. The survey highlights certain existing challenges and provides directions to address them effectively. In addition, new research directions are also identified. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Data security; Intrusion Detection; Network security; Swarm intelligence","Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Internet of things; Network security; Surveys; Swarm intelligence; Attack vector; Fundamental building blocks; Information leakage; Intelligent techniques; Intrusion detection models; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion-Detection; Networks security; Performance; Systematic literature review; Intrusion detection",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122993534

Fog computing (FC) takes the cloud closer to IoT computers to overcome these problems. Rather than moving them to the cloud, the FC provides local IoT data processing and storage on IoT computers. This paper focuses on the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Network (RPL), a universally routing protocol for a static environment that is used for reducing energy consumption, delay, and packet loss with data aggregation at the border router using a fog simulation model in Contiki Cooja. The objective function (OF) choice has an impact on network topology, as each node selects a set of potential parents to send to the destination. However, no systematic analysis of the effects of OF behavior in the RPL environment has been undertaken. Here, three different OFs, Objective Function Zero (OF0), Advanced Objective Function Zero (AOF0), and Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective Function (MRHOF) for RPL in the static environment for different node numbers, have been compared. The findings demonstrate that altering all three OFs has a significant impact on RPL. The energy consumption is reduced in the case of the AOF0 in the fog node by 50.86%, which is less than the case of the OF0 and MRHOF function.

Firstly, a joint-image-transformation-based scheme is proposed to preprocess the measurement data variation, so that the distribution characteristics of measurement data variation are more significant. Secondly, the deviation between the probability distribution of measurement data variation and the histogram are obtained based on the earth’s mover distance.

Many studies of this type focus on generating the desired future, taking into account the fact that it is accompanied by uncertainty. The author of this publication postulates treating uncertainty as an equivalent—in relation to the future—research object. This approach allows us to formulate general assumptions for a model of the anticipatory management of systemic uncertainty in IoT networks. The goal of such a model will not be to eliminate or even minimize uncertainty, but to regulate it to a desired level. Such an action can bring many more benefits than trying to zero out uncertainty. On the general side, uncertainty can be studied in two ways: (1) as an abstract idea, or (2) as a feature of a particular structure, also with elements of research on its abstract component. In this paper the attention is focused on the second approach. The main research area is the IoT network in its broadest sense, with a particular role of the social construct, in the context of the study of systemic uncertainty in relation to selected anticipatory actions.

Achieving rapid message signing and verification for authentication is challenging due to complex operations, such as bilinear pairs. This paper proposes a secure pseudonym-based conditional privacy-persevering authentication scheme for communication security in VANETs. The Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and secure hash cryptographic function were used in the proposed scheme for signing and verifying messages. After a vehicle receives a significant amount of pseudo-IDs and the corresponding signature key from the Trusted Authority (TA), it uses them to sign a message during the broadcasting process. Thus, the proposed scheme requires each vehicle to check all the broadcasting messages received. Besides, in the proposed scheme, the TA can revoke misbehaving vehicles from continuously broadcasting signed messages, thus preventing insider attacks. The security analysis proved that the proposed scheme fulfilled the security requirements, including identity privacy-preservation, message integrity and authenticity, unlinkability, and traceability. The proposed scheme also withstood common security attacks such as man-in-the-middle, impersonation, modification, and replay attacks. Besides, our scheme was resistant against an adaptive chosen-message attack under the random oracle model. Furthermore, our scheme did not employ bilinear pairing operations; therefore, the performance analysis and comparison showed a lower resulting overhead than other identity-based schemes. The computation costs of the message signing, individual signature authentication, and batch signature authentication were reduced by 49%, 33.3%, and 90.2%, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.

The adopted solution implemented the following security features: open authorization, multi-factor authentication, identity brokering, and user management to safeguard microservice APIs. Then, we extended the security solution with a virtual private network (VPN), Blowfish and crypt (Bcrypt) hash, encryption method, API key, network firewall, and secure socket layer (SSL) to build up a digital infrastructure. To accomplish and describe the adopted SSK solution, we utilized a web engineering security method. As a case study, we designed and developed an electronic health coaching (eCoach) prototype system and hosted the system in the expanded digital secure infrastructure to collect and exchange personal health data over microservice APIs. We further described our adopted security solution’s procedural, technical, and practical considerations. We validated our SSK solution implementation by theoretical evaluation and experimental testing. We have compared the test outcomes with related studies qualitatively to determine the efficacy of the hybrid security solution in digital infrastructure. The SSK implementation and configuration in the eCoach prototype system has effectively secured its microservice APIs from an attack in all the considered scenarios with 100% accuracy. The developed digital infrastructure with SSK solution efficiently sustained a load of (≈)300 concurrent users. In addition, we have performed a qualitative comparison among the following security solutions: Spring-based security, Keycloak-based security, and their combination (our utilized hybrid security solution), where SSK showed a promising outcome. © 2022 by the authors.

Malicious agents threaten patients’ health and life by stealing or altering data as it flows among the multiple domains of healthcare networks. The problem is likely to exacerbate with the increasing use of IoT devices, edge, and core clouds in the next generation healthcare networks. Presented in this paper is MUSE, a system of deep hierarchical stacked neural networks for timely and accurate detection of malicious activity that leads to alteration of meta-information or payload of the dataflow between the IoT gateway, edge and core clouds. Smaller models at the edge clouds take substantially less time to train as compared to the large models in the core cloud. To improve the speed of training and accuracy of detection of large core cloud models, the MUSE system uses a novel method of merging and aggregating layers of trained edge cloud models to construct a partly pre-trained core cloud model. As a result, the model in the core cloud takes substantially smaller number of epochs (6 to 8) and, consequently, less time, compared to those in the edge clouds, training of which take 35 to 40 epochs to converge. With the help of extensive evaluations, it is shown that with the MUSE system, large, merged models can be trained in significantly less time than the unmerged models that are created independently in the core cloud. Through several runs it is seen that the merged models give on an average 26.2% reduction in training times. From the experimental evaluation we demonstrate that along with fast training speeds the merged MUSE model gives high training and test accuracies, ranging from 95% to 100%, in detection of unknown attacks on dataflows. The merged model thus generalizes very well on the test data. This is a marked improvement when compared with the accuracy given by un-merged model as well as accuracy reported by other researchers with newer datasets. © 2022","Cloud networks; Critical healthcare; Deep neural networks; Edge clouds; Hierarchical neural networks; Multi-cloud systems; Network function virtualization; Stacked autoencoders","Cloud computing; Deep neural networks; Gateways (computer networks); Hierarchical systems; Internet of things; Network function virtualization; Auto encoders; Cloud modeling; Cloud networks; Cloud systems; Critical healthcare; Edge clouds; Hierarchical neural networks; Multi-cloud system; Multi-clouds; Stacked autoencoder; Health care",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124877724

Some aspects of these investigations are inevitably contingent on trust, however this is not always explicitly considered or critically evaluated. Erroneously treating features of the investigation as trusted can be enormously damaging to the overall reliability of an investigation's findings as well as the confidence that external stakeholders can have in it. As an example, digital crime scenes can be manipulated by tampering with the digital artefacts left on devices, yet recent studies have shown that efforts to detect occurrences of this are rare and argue that this leaves digital forensics investigations vulnerable to accusations of inaccuracy. In this paper a new approach to digital forensics is considered based on the concept of Zero Trust, an increasingly popular design in network security. Zero Trust describes the practitioner mindset and principles upon which the reliance on trust in network components is eliminated in favour of dynamic verification of network interactions. An initial Definition of Zero Trust Digital Forensics will be proposed and then a specific example considered showing how this strategy can be applied to digital forensic investigations to mitigate against the specific risk of evidence tampering. A definition of Zero Trust Digital Forensics is proposed, specifically that it is ‘a strategy adopted by investigators whereby each aspect of an investigation is assumed to be unreliable until verified’. A new principle will be introduced, namely the ‘multifaceted verification of digital artefacts’ that can be used by practitioners who wish to adopt a Zero Trust Digital Forensics strategy during their investigations. A qualitative review of existing artefact verification techniques is also conducted in order to briefly evaluate the viability of this approach based on current research efforts. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-forensics; Evidence tampering; Reliability; Trust; Verification; Zero Trust","Computer crime; Digital devices; Electronic crime countermeasures; Network security; Anti-Forensics; Digital artifacts; Digital crime; Evidence tampering; External stakeholders; Forensic investigation; In networks; Reliable results; Trust; Zero trust; Digital forensics",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124431744

Several previous machine learning (ML)-based network intrusion detection approaches have been developed to protect against DDoS attacks. However, existing ML detection approaches diagnose the causality between attacks and traffic features based mainly on purely associative features. Causal reasoning shows that this inability to disentangle correlation from causation can result in diagnostic errors. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a framework of DDoS detection based on causal reasoning to solve the problem of false associations. This framework consists of two main parts: feature selection based on “do-operations” and attack detection by counterfactual diagnosis. First, the noise features that are falsely associated with DDoS attacks are deleted during the “do-operations”. Then, the expected number of anomaly features under different DDoS attack types is calculated in the counterfactual situations. The larger the expected value that is calculated for a certain attack, the more likely it is that the anomaly features of the testing data are caused by this attack. The experiments show that the causality between DDoS attacks and the anomaly features can be fully described by our method, which, compared to other classic ML associative methods, increases the detection accuracy by approximately 5% on average. © 2022","Accuracy; Counterfactual diagnosis; Detecting DDoS; Do-operations; False association","Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Network security; Accuracy; Causal reasoning; Counterfactual diagnose; Counterfactuals; Denialof- service attacks; Detecting distributed denial of service; Distributed denial of service; Do-operation; False association; Intrusion-Detection; Denial-of-service attack",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123871072

However, with the increasing complexity of malware and the continuous development of anti-detection techniques, a lot of malicious programs evolve over time. As a result, the deep learning-based methods may fail to recognize these time evolved malware samples, which poses a critical challenge to deploy the deep learning models in practice. In this paper, we first implement two well-known deep learning-based malware detection models: MalConv and TextCNN. From our experiments that divide the dataset according to the timestamp information for model training and testing, we found the detection performance of the two models both decline obviously when they process the time evolved malware. To address this problem, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on two-head neural network. This method can identify the time evolved samples. These samples would make the previous trained deep learning models misclassified. The experiments show that the malware detection accuracies can be improved by 8.62% for MalConv and 13.12% for TextCNN after the identified samples are filtered. This indicates that our method could effectively improve the usability of the pre-trained models on processing the new data.

Failure to detect large-scale attacks like DDoS not only makes the networks vulnerable, but a failure of critical lifesaving medical and industrial equipment can also put human lives at risk. Lack of availability of comprehensive and quality network datasets and the narrow scope to build an IDS based on a single machine learning classifier adds further limitations. Such issues can risk producing inaccurate or biased results in the solutions proposed by various researchers. Toward this end, this paper analyzed several datasets (old, recent, non-IoT, and IoT specific) using several individual and hybrid deep learning classifiers. Our goal is to establish a benchmark that can compare several classification models on several datasets to limit (1) dataset quality issues and (2) possible bias in produced results. We reported our empirical results by revealing exciting findings on some of the classifiers, which took hours to converge but could not successfully detect attacks. In contrast, others quickly converged and were able to produce the best results in terms of accuracy and other performance metrics.

Their primary purpose is the protection of user data, both in transit and at rest. One of the de facto methods to evaluate block cipher security is differential cryptanalysis. Differential cryptanalysis observes the propagation of input patterns (input differences) through the cipher to produce output patterns (output differences). This probabilistic propagation is known as a differential; the identification of which is a measure of a block cipher's security margins. This paper introduces an optimized GPU-based branch-and-bound framework for differential search. We optimize search efficiency by parallelizing all branch-and-bound operations, completing the entire search on the GPU without communicating with the CPU. The meet-in-the-middle (MITM) approach is also adopted for further performance gains. We analyze the financial and computational costs of the proposed framework using Google Cloud VM to showcase its practicality. When optimized for performance, we can attain up to 90x speedup while saving up to 47% of the running cost as compared to a single CPU core. When optimized for cost, the proposed framework can save up to 83% of financial costs while retaining a speedup of up to 40x. As a proof of concept, the proposed framework was then applied on 128-bit TRIFLE-BC, 64-bit PRESENT, and 64-bit GIFT. Notably, we identified the best differentials for PRESENT (16 rounds) and 64-bit GIFT (13 rounds) to date, with estimated probabilities of 2−61.7964 and 2−60.66 respectively. Although the differential results for TRIFLE-BC were incremental, the proposed framework was able to construct differentials for 43 rounds that consisted of approximately 5.8x more individual trails than previous work, making it one of the most efficient approaches for larger block ciphers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Automatic search; Block cipher; Branch-and-bound; Cryptanalysis; Differential; Differential cryptanalysis; GPU","Cryptography; Gears; Graphics processing unit; Network security; At rests; Automatic searches; Block ciphers; Branch and bounds; Cryptanalyse; Differential; Differential cryptanalysis; Financial costs; Security protocols; User data; Lyapunov methods",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123033410

Some security professionals argue that legacy IT systems significantly increase security risks because they are not designed to address contemporary cybersecurity risks. Others counter that the legacy systems might be “secure by antiquity” and argue that due to lack of adequate documentation on the systems, it is very difficult for potential attackers to discover and exploit security vulnerabilities. There is a shortage of empirical evidence on either argument. Routine activity theory (RAT) argues that an organization's guardianship is critical for reducing security incidents. However, RAT does not well explain how organizations might guard against security risks of legacy IT systems. We theorize that organizations can enhance their guardianship by either modernizing their legacy IT systems in-house or by outsourcing them to cloud vendors. With datasets from the U.S. federal agencies, we find that agencies that have more legacy IT systems experience more frequent security incidents than others with more modern IT systems. A 1%-point increase in the proportion of IT budgets spent on IT modernization is associated with a 5.6% decrease in the number of security incidents. Furthermore, migration of the legacy systems to the cloud is negatively associated with the number of security incidents. The findings advance the literature on strategic information systems by extending RAT to explain why the “security by antiquity” argument is not valid and how organizations can reduce the security risks of legacy IT systems through modernization and migration to the cloud. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","IT modernization; Legacy IT systems; Migration to the cloud; Security risks; U.S. federal government","Budget control; Cloud data security; Cybersecurity; Modernization; Rats; Cyber security; IT modernization; IT system; Legacy IT system; Migration to the cloud; Routine activity theories; Security incident; Security risks; Strategic role; U.S. federal government; Legacy systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122994189

The purpose of this study is to explain the acceptance and usage of SCOs and therefore extend the technology acceptance model (TAM; Davis, 1989) with other theories (i.e., uses and gratification, diffusion of innovation, privacy calculus), and thus new antecedents adapted to the SCO context. More specifically, in addition to the TAM's main variables (i.e., perceived usefulness, ease of use, intention to use, real use), we investigate the roles of concepts rarely investigated in innovation and new technology research, such as well-being, social image, privacy concerns, and innovativeness. We also study the differences in the adoption of SCOs between different user adoption stages, such as the early adopters, early majority, and late majority (Rogers, 1983). The data come from 702 respondents surveyed in a longitudinal study over three years of their acceptance and real usage. Structural equation modeling shows that the TAM variables remain relevant in the SCO context. The results show that utilitarian benefits are the main reasons leading to SCO technology acceptance, and well-being and social image lead to higher usage in the long term. However, privacy concerns are the main obstacles to the adoption of SCOs. © 2022","adoption stage; diffusion of innovation; innovativeness; IoT; privacy concerns; smart connected objects; technology acceptance; well-being","Calculations; Diffusion; Adoption stage; Diffusion of innovations; Innovativeness; Privacy concerns; Smart connected object; Social images; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance model; Uses and gratifications; Well being; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122800068

SDN is more secure and immune to DDoS attacks than traditional networks due to the bifurcation of the control and data planes, a global perspective of the whole network, centralized network control, and many other features. SDN still seems to be vulnerable to new DDoS attacks that can target the Application plane, control plane, or data plane, as well as the SDN architectural communication channels. In this paper, we propose a novel optimized weighted voting ensemble model to detect DDoS attack in an SDN environment. The proposed ensemble employs six base classifiers (two SVMs, two Random forests, and two Gradient Boosted Machines) that are differentiated by hyperparameter values. The optimal set of weights are identified by a novel hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm (BHO). Our approach eliminates false negatives by employing a novel dynamic fitness function.

Legacy Industrial Control System (ICS) devices, now interconnected via public networks, are exposed to a wide range of previously unconsidered threats, which must be considered to ensure the continued safe operation of industrial processes. This paper surveys the ICS honeypot deployments in the literature to date, provides an overview of ICS focused threat vectors, and studies how honeypots can be integrated within an organisations defensive strategy. We discuss relevant legislation, such as the UK Cyber Assessment Framework, the US NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, and associated industry-based standards and guidelines supporting operator compliance. This is used to frame a discussion on our survey of existing ICS honeypot implementations, and the role of honeypots in supporting regulatory objectives. We observe that many low-interaction honeypots are limited in their use. This is largely due to the increased knowledge attackers have on how real-world ICS devices are configured and operate vs the configurability of simulated honeypot systems. Furthermore, we find that environments with increased interaction provide more extensive capabilities and value, due to their inherent obfuscation delivered through the use of real-world systems. Based on these insights, we propose a novel framework towards the classification and implementation of ICS honeypots. © 2021 The Author(s)","Critical infrastructure; Honeypots; ICS; Industrial control systems; Malware; Security","Control systems; Critical infrastructures; Intelligent control; Malware; Manufacture; Network security; Public works; Regulatory compliance; Surveys; Control system security; Critical infrastructure; Honeypots; Industrial control systems; Manufacturing technologies; Production technology; Security; Smart manufacturing; Traditional manufacturing; Cybersecurity",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122265648

So the prediction and control of thermal errors are essential. But the prediction and control are a process involving the processing of a large-volume thermal data, and then the processing efficiency is low, which severely hinders the geometric precision improvement. To solve this problem, a new mist-edge-fog-cloud system (MEFCS) architecture is proposed for the error prediction and control. A finite element model is established to prove the applicability of bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network. A cosine and sine gray wolf optimization (CSGWO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the batch size. Then the CSGWO-Bi-LSTM network error model is proposed. The predictive accuracy is 90.80%, 94.57%, 95.77%, 96.79%, 97.51%, 98.45%, and 98.92% for the multiple linear regression model, recurrent neural network, LSTM network, Bi-LSTM network, CSGWO1-Bi-LSTM network, CSGWO2-Bi-LSTM network, and CSGWO3-Bi-LSTM network, respectively. The volume of the transferred data is reduced by 11/16 with the data-based model, and the volume of the transferred thermal data is reduced to 1/10 with the designed system. A precision threshold is set, and the predictive accuracy is improved by 8.31% by the system with the precision threshold compared with the system without the precision threshold. With the proposed MEFCS, the accuracy level of the tooth profile deviation fHα is increased from ISO level 5 to ISO level 3.

By introducing a novel scheme, sufficient conditions are provided to ensure the asymptotic stability of resultant sliding mode dynamics with prescribed H∞ performance. Subsequently, to reduce the communication burden, an optimal strategy is proposed which can guarantee the stability simultaneously through choosing suitable weighting matrices. Moreover, a projection-based adaptive SMC law is designed to compensate the effects caused by the LE and FDIA, which can force the system state to be attracted into the pre-defined sliding manifold.

The cyber vulnerability has however been identified as an emerging problem and a potential barrier influencing MASS development. This paper, through the investigation of the fundamental trust problem with regards to the cyber security of MASS systems, aims to develop a blockchain-based scheme for the trust management of MASS. The innovative idea of using blockchain within the MASS context is that the mobile entities in the MASS operational environment constitute a decentralized opportunity network, which makes blockchain an appealing tool to provide a solution to evaluating and maximizing the trust over the dynamics of the entities. This paper elaborates the mechanism by which the MASS entities participate in keeping the main chain. Firstly, the paper illustrates how the Belief of Trust (BoT) among the entities is encoded and assembled into the chain, to allow MASS entities to have an initial judgement towards another entity before they get acquainted. Secondly, at the consensus layer of blockchain technique, it addresses how the witness, who has a temporary right of producing a block and append it to the chain, can be elected among the nodes and how to incent the nodes to maintain the blockchain from a proof-of-stake perspective. Finally, this paper describes how the MASS entities can use the certificate dependence information to evaluate the trust transition in the MASS operating environment. Typical scenarios are delineated to show the procedure of certificate inquiry, handover of controls between maritime supervision centers and shore-side remote control centers in case of the occurrence of unexpected events. The findings provide any entity in an MASS network with an effective solution to evaluating the degree of trust he can have for any targeted node/participant. They can therefore help choose better (more trustable) nodes to maintain the MASS network's knowledge of evidence to judge the trust on an unknown member. © 2021","Blockchain; Cyber security; Decentralized entities; Maritime security; MASS; Trustworthiness management","Cybersecurity; Network security; Remote control; Ships; Block-chain; Cyber security; Decentralised; Decentralized entity; Maritime administrations; Maritime autonomous surface ship; Maritime security; Ship systems; Surface ship; Trustworthiness management; Blockchain",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121964153

The negative effects of these attacks can not only disrupt or completely disable the system functioning, but also they can have serious safety related consequences. Therefore, cybersecurity in ICS becomes one of the most important issues. In this paper we propose a method for the design of algorithms for the detection of cyber-attacks on communication links between smart devices. The method belongs to the class of semi-supervised data driven approaches and it is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Starting from a predefined range of network hyperparameters and data obtained from system operation without attacks, the proposed method autonomously selects suitable CNN architecture and thresholds for online intrusion detection. Following the characteristics of ICS, the proposed intrusion detection is host based, and in our research we consider the structure of ICS and the feasibility of the attack detection algorithm implementation on control system devices. The method is experimentally verified using two case studies. In the first case study that refers to the publicly available dataset obtained from Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed, we present a comparative analysis of the developed method with alternative approaches.

First, we investigate and assess the severity of the IEC 60 870-5-104 cyberattacks by providing a quantitative threat model, which relies on Attack Defence Trees and Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1. Next, we introduce an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS), which is capable of discriminating and mitigating automatically the IEC 60 870-5-104 cyberattacks. The proposed IDPS takes full advantage of the machine learning (ML) and software defined networking (SDN) technologies.

This makes it difficult for trust to be established and an effective equilibrium to be reached among parties. Therefore, it is essential to ensure coordination among all parties and for all parties to collaborate effectively to avoid this problem. This helps to create a favourable environment and ensures profitability on the supply chain. Previous works have attempted to achieve this by making use of contracting mechanisms to regulate IoT devices and nodes on the network. In these systems, parties are enticed to act in a way so that profit achieved in the supply chain is maximized. However, these contracting mechanisms utilized are centralized and can easily be compromised. Also, these contracts are not enforced by a framework that ensures the effective establishment of trust among parties on the supply chain. Also, equilibrium remains in-established due to the complexity and lack of an effective system to regulate behaviour effectively. In this work, we design a blockchain-adaptive framework that incentivizes participants to work together on the supply chain to establish an equilibrium. We show through a proof of Concept, that the blockchain possesses the necessary attributes needed in establishing a Nash Equilibrium and can be used to coordinate the supply chain in complex scenarios to ensure security, trust, and profit. Using game theory models, we develop novel approaches and prove mathematically that the blockchain is more efficient in establishing a supply chain equilibrium among parties, ensuring fairness among various parties. Additionally, we utilize smart contracts to calculate each participating party's expected payoff and profit. We also attempt to reduce the level of uncertainties across the supply chain by presenting profit-maximizing parties. Here the transparency provided by the blockchain provides a means to collate information relevant for making effective decisions on the blockchain which proves relevant in multi-complex supply chain networks such as aircraft, and vehicle manufacturing and assembling networks. Here, parties are thus incentivized to make the right decisions. We observe through our test that the blockchain provides all parties with the best payoff that satisfies all parties by incorporating each individual's decisions on the supply chain, ensuring trust and equilibrium are established. The implementation of our work was achieved using standard blockchain networks. Our results show the cost-efficiency and feasibility of our proposed idea. © 2021","Blockchain; Game-theory; IoT; Smart contract; Supply chain","Complex networks; Game theory; Internet of things; Profitability; Supply chains; Adaptive framework; Block-chain; Centralised; Critical component; Effective systems; Game theory models; Nash equilibria; Proof of concept; Show through; Uncertainty; Smart contract",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121388238

This paper specifies the cyber-threat landscape of border control infrastructures to assist professionals in assessing the relevant cybersecurity risks. Border control infrastructures are complex environments and relevant risks might not be easily identified. To investigate the cyber-threat landscape of these infrastructures, a mixed research method, combining qualitative and quantitative results, and using border-related expert interviews and risk analysis investigation was chosen. Key contributions of this work include the classification of a widespread set of border assets, the description of the profiles of threat actors and their potential synergies, the specification of a threat taxonomy applicable to all border types, and the identification of potential areas of vulnerability.

Fog computing alleviates the processing and storage burden during data replication from the cloud to the network edge closer to sensor devices. Numerous data replica schemes in fog computing have been proposed to improve the performance efficiency of the data, reduce the turnaround delays of data access, and minimize network latency.

Patients diagnosed with diabetes are the leading beneficiaries of IoTMD, assisting them in maintaining their sugar level at a normal range. However, the security defense of these systems against potential cyberthreats is currently underdeveloped. Such threats must not be ignored as they can put the lives of the patients in danger. Thus, this paper proposes deep learning (DL)-based anomaly detection system composed of estimation and classification models applied to a subdomain in healthcare systems referred to as Diabetes Management Control System (DMCS). The estimation model was used to forecast the glucose level of patients at each evaluation time step, whereas the classification model is intended to detect anomalous data points. This paper implements convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms for comparison purposes. Moreover, considering that the dataset contains sensitive physiological information of the patients, this paper implements the independent learning (IL) and federated learning (FL) methods to maintain user data privacy. Furthermore, the post-quantization compression technique was also applied to convert models into their lightweight version, overcoming the computationally demanding processes of DL. Based on the experiment results, the FL method showed a higher recall rate (> = 98.69%) than the IL method (< = 97.87%). Additionally, the FL-aided CNN-based anomaly detection system performs better than the MLP-based approach. The former achieved an average recall rate of 99.24%, whereas the latter only attained 98.69%. Without loss of recall value, the inference latency of the models was tremendously reduced from more than 300 ms to less than two milliseconds when the original models were converted to their lightweight version. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence of things; Diabetes; Diabetes management; Federated learning; Intrusion detection system","Anomaly detection; Control systems; Data privacy; Deep learning; Health care; Internet of things; Multilayer neural networks; Patient monitoring; Anomaly detection systems; Artificial intelligence of thing; Classification models; Diabetes management; Estimation models; Federated learning; Intrusion Detection Systems; Learning methods; Management control system; Medical Devices; Intrusion detection",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118582276

This irrelevant feature plays a major role in making confusion between the normal data pattern against the attack data pattern.

Various VM migration-based approaches are modeled for better VM placement but remain the challenge because of inappropriate load balancing. Thus, workload prediction-based VM migration is introduced to improve the energy efficiency of the system. Importantly, load prediction is very important to enhance resource allocation and utilization. Chaotic Fruitfly Rider Neural Network is devised by combining Rider neural network and chaotic Fruitfly optimization algorithm to predict load. Moreover, the fitness for predicting the load is based on old-time load, resource constraint, and network parameters. Once the load is predicted, the power optimization is performed using VM migration and optimal switching strategy. When the load is found overloaded, the VM migration is performed using the proposed Harris Hawks spider monkey optimization (HHSMO). Thus, the optimal finding of VM for executing the removed task is found out using the proposed HHSMO. The fitness function utilized for the VM migration is based on power, load, and resource parameter. If the load predicted is underloaded, the optimal switch ON/OFF is done optimally by switch ON/OFF the servers using the proposed HHSMO algorithm. Through the migration and switching strategy, the power consumption is optimized. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in terms of power consumption, load, and resource utilization. The proposed HHSMO achieves the minimal power consumption of 0.0181, the minimal load of 0.002, and the minimal resource utilization of 0.0376. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Chaotic fruitfly optimization algorithm; Harris Hawks optimization algorithm; Power consumption; Rider neural network; Workload prediction","Balancing; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Green computing; Network security; Optimization; Power management; Virtual machine; Chaotic fruitfly optimization algorithm; Chaotics; Fruitflies; Harris hawk optimization algorithm; Neural-networks; Optimization algorithms; Rider neural network; Virtual machine migrations; Workload predictions; Electric power utilization",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116816180

However, simultaneous failure of more than one device is more dangerous and might result in cascading failures. Due to cyber-attacks and malicious motivations, attacking several components of the system is more probable. Various methods have been proposed for contingency screening, which are mainly time-consuming and cannot be applied to real systems. On the other hand, there is no integrated algorithm for screening N-1, N-k, and N-1-1 contingencies. In this paper, an indirect method has been presented for this purpose. The proposed method extracts different critical contingencies through screening contingencies in offline mode for some selected operating modes. Then, they are clustered using the Gaussian-mixture model using the expectation–maximization algorithm. Therefore, the boundary between data is specified, which helps to find the closest (the most similar) operating modes. In online mode, the critical contingencies of the closest trained data are introduced as the critical contingency set of the present operating point. To the best of our knowledge, this study employs the correlation between the loads and generators in contingency screening for the first time.

Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) analyzes network packets and reports low-level security violations to system administrators. In large networks, these reports become unmanageable. Moreover, state-of-the-art systems suffer from high false alarms. A NIDS should be anomaly-based to have the ability to discover zero-day attacks. Most NIDSs proposed by researchers that were based on such techniques suffered from high false alarms. This paper introduces an intelligent lightweight IDS that has a low false alarm rate while maintaining a high detection rate. The proposed NIDS is a fusion between two main subsystems that work in parallel. Each subsystem is trained using One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM). One of the systems is trained over normal packets, while the other is trained over attack packets. The results of both subsystems are combined to give a good judgment for each packet that passes through the network. The proposed NIDS has been evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art systems using three popular IDS datasets (KDDCUP-99, NSL-KDD, and UNSW-NB15) in terms of detection rate, accuracy, f-measure and false alarms.

The main aim of this article is to present a literature to identify and recognize CAPTCHA, its types, the creation and breaking techniques. It is a systematic and complete analysis of all available CAPTCHA types. In this paper, 16 text-based CAPTCHA’s generation methods are discussed with usability and security ranges from 3 to 100 and 65 to 100%, respectively. The security and usability measures are not calculated/sustained using some known English schemes. Out of 16 reviewed CAPTCHAs, 12 are based on English language, 1 on Arabic language, 1 on Chinese language, 1 on Devanagari language and 1 on Gurumukhi script. The designs are made segment proof with overlapping random shapes, overlapping characters, clasping, different colors and different shades. For making recognition proof many techniques are used like image masking, local and global warping; broken characters, random rotation, arcs, jaws, etc. Approximately 50 schemes, especially based on the English language, are successfully broken with a success rate that ranges from 2 to 100%. The techniques that are used to break these schemes include shape context matching, distortion estimation, Log Gabor 2D filter, horizontal and vertical projection (for a segment the letters) are used. For recognition CNN, KNN, DNN and MCDNN are used. Almost 15 images-based CAPTCHAs are discussed that are designed with usability and security range 90–100 and 17–100%, respectively. Out of these 5 schemes are successfully broken with a success rate ranging between 7 and 100%. The K-NN and SVM are mostly used algorithms to recognize the images.

In this article, an NSM security monitoring platform for a realistic IEC 61850 substation model is developed using the specifications provided in IEC 62351-7. In the developed model, grid measurements are ready to take operative decisions, whereas collected NSM data are leveraged to detect cyberattacks and/or identify anomalies. The model includes power components (e.g., transformers, lines, and generators), controllers (e.g., voltage control), protection devices (e.g., overcurrent, distance, differential, and under/overvoltage), communication protocols (e.g., sampled value and generic object-oriented substation event), and NSM (e.g., agents and managers) applications. Moreover, a two-step deep learning framework is proposed for anomaly detection and cyberattack identification with enhanced accuracy. The first step can apply long short-term memory, recurrent neural network, and gated recurrent units, each in combination with an autoencoder. Then, the ensemble learning technique is used in the second step to augment the outputs of these deep learning models.

A particularly pernicious attack is spoofing, in which a malicious agent spawns multiple identities and can compromise otherwise attack-resilient algorithms that rely on assumed network robustness structures. We generalize a class of resilient consensus strategies, known as weighted mean-subsequence-reduced (W-MSR) consensus, to further provide spoof resilience by incorporating a physical layer authentication. By comparing the physical fingerprints of received signals, legitimate agents can identify and isolate malicious agents that attempt spoofing attacks. A key technical contribution is to quantify worst case misclassification probability using distributionally robust Chebyshev bounds computed via semidefinite programming when the physical fingerprints of received signals are stochastic.

However, these applications require the implementations to be light-weight but still real-time, with the additional feature of being flexible. The flexibility can come from different choices of underlying algorithms along with suitable parameter choices. A software implementation offers better flexibility but lacks in timing performance, whereas custom hardware delivers better performance but has poor flexibility. Furthermore, the designs over small characteristic curves are now insecure against recent attacks. Existing designs do not address the drawback of less flexibility and huge resource consumption collectively. In this article, we present a micro-program controlled hardware design which has the least resource consumption among the similar existing designs on FPGA that offer such programmability and flexibility. This redundant number arithmetic-based architecture consumes only 2506 slices on Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. It can be migrated to other device families or updated for different algorithms without data-path or control-path modification.

However, detecting attacks from traffic data stream accurately is rather challenging. The great diversity and variation of network intrusions make the intrusion feature extraction difficult, and the serious imbalanced class distribution makes common classifiers cannot work properly. Traditional methods for intrusion detection suffer from some obvious drawbacks. Classic machine learning-based methods seriously depend on the pre-defined features, automatic feature learning-based methods usually overfit the training data and neglect the problem of imbalanced data distribution, and the unsupervised learning-based methods are not suitable for dealing with multi-class classification of attacks. In this paper, to understand the characteristics of network traffic clearly, we analyze the class distribution of classic intrusion datasets through visualization. Based on the observed characteristics we innovatively propose exploiting distinctive features of each type of traffic from three perspectives, namely, anomaly identification, clustering and classification. We consider the feature learning in each perspective as a single task, then propose three models to fulfill three tasks, namely, an Autoencoder-based contrastive learning model, a supervised learning-based clustering model, and MLP-based classifier, and we also develop a unified framework to integrate three models for accomplishing intrusion detection comprehensively. Additionally, we propose a customized loss function to deal with imbalanced distribution of traffic data. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three classic intrusion detection datasets.

In consideration of the features of applications, the strategy deploys VMs based on the resource preferences of applications as well as the remained resources of the hosts. Utilizing the resource preferences the weights of various resources are determined, and the weight tables for VMs are obtained. Combining the resources weights of VMs and the resource configurations of physical hosts the values whether the resources are used in balance are calculated.

While some traffic classification applications (e.g. QoS based path allocation) can tolerate delays, other applications (e.g. attack detection) are time critical. In this context, early traffic classification has been proposed based on the first few packets of flows. However, the choice of the number of packets to inspect is method dependent and based on empirical assessment without considering the information carried by these packets (features). In this paper, we aim at identifying the sufficient number of packets, N, that guarantees high classification accuracy while optimizing the response time, based on both empirical classification results and information theory. We propose a confidence measure based on the variations in the model training accuracy and the average mutual information among the packets’ features and the label vector. This measure is then used to define the value of N, which optimizes the trade-off between the time overhead and the classification accuracy. In addition, we propose an ensemble Deep Learning (DL)-based classifier model to enhance the classification accuracy by training successive DL models based on the traffic stream. The proposed ensemble method output is based on the average of the individual classifiers predictions. The experimental results show that when using the proposed confidence measure, we can achieve good classification accuracy at early phase of the flow. In addition, using the proposed ensemble method presents enhancement in the early classification accuracy. Consequently, combining the ensemble method with the confidence measure criteria allows for striking a good balance between high accuracy and fast response time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Internet of Things; Internet traffic; Real-time classification; Traffic classification; Traffic management","Deep learning; Economic and social effects; Information theory; Internet of things; Quality of service; Classification accuracy; Confidence Measure; Ensemble methods; Internet traffic; Quality-of-service; Real- time; Real-time classification; Realtime traffic; Traffic classification; Traffic management; Classification (of information)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123234833

Their vulnerability to malware has motivated the need for efficient techniques to detect infected IoT devices inside networks. With data privacy and integrity becoming a major concern in recent years, increasing with the arrival of 5G and Beyond networks, new technologies such as federated learning and blockchain emerged. They allow training machine learning models with decentralized data while preserving its privacy by design. This work investigates the possibilities enabled by federated learning concerning IoT malware detection and studies security issues inherent to this new learning paradigm. In this context, a framework that uses federated learning to detect malware affecting IoT devices is presented. N-BaIoT, a dataset modeling network traffic of several real IoT devices while affected by malware, has been used to evaluate the proposed framework. Both supervised and unsupervised federated models (multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder) able to detect malware affecting seen and unseen IoT devices of N-BaIoT have been trained and evaluated. Furthermore, their performance has been compared to two traditional approaches. The first one lets each participant locally train a model using only its own data, while the second consists of making the participants share their data with a central entity in charge of training a global model. This comparison has shown that the use of more diverse and large data, as done in the federated and centralized methods, has a considerable positive impact on the model performance. Besides, the federated models, while preserving the participant's privacy, show similar results as the centralized ones. As an additional contribution and to measure the robustness of the federated approach, an adversarial setup with several malicious participants poisoning the federated model has been considered. The baseline model aggregation averaging step used in most federated learning algorithms appears highly vulnerable to different attacks, even with a single adversary. The performance of other model aggregation functions acting as countermeasures is thus evaluated under the same attack scenarios. These functions provide a significant improvement against malicious participants, but more efforts are still needed to make federated approaches robust. © 2022 The Authors","Adversarial attack; Botnet detection; Federated learning; IoT device; IoT security","5G mobile communication systems; Botnet; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Malware; Network security; Privacy-preserving techniques; Adversarial attack; Botnet detections; Centralised; Federated learning; IoT device; IoT security; Malicious participant; Malware detection; Model aggregations; Performance; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122584894

In a clone node attack, an adversary aims to physically capture the secret credentials of the deployed IoT devices to make the clone of devices look similar to the original devices. In recent years, several solutions for detecting clone node attacks have been designed; however, the focus of such designed solutions is on system design discussion, specific feature sets, high-level abstraction of underlying system architecture and fulfilling the performance analysis requirements. While the designed solutions efficiently detect clone attacks, critical features such as modelling, analysis, and verification of such solutions are frequently overlooked, necessitating that users verify their internal behaviour and claimed properties to ensure that no problematic scenarios or anomalies exist. Taking into account the rationale for formal verification and the limitations of previous works, this paper aims to perform formal modelling, analysis, and verification of our existing proposed clone node attack detection scheme for IoT. We used the High-Level Petri Nets (HLPNs) and Z-specification language to model our proposed scheme and analyse the logic correctness of our scheme using incidence markings and confidence interval matrices. To validate the functional correctness, we utilised the Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library (SMT-Lib) and the Z3 Solver and verified the functional satisfiable properties by analysing sat/unsat verification results and their execution time. Finally, we extend our modelling work by utilising the Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs), taking into consideration their both timed and untimed models with the aim of validating functional correctness and logical correctness, respectively.

The proposed secure data delivery scheme implements Fountain Codes, namely RaptorQ (RQ) codes, at the application layer (AL) to increase communication security against eavesdroppers' attacks. For RQ coded transmission scheme, the receiver has to collect a sufficient number of coded packets to reconstruct the original source data. Secure delivery can be achieved if the legitimate user obtains enough RQ coded packets before the eavesdropper does. To satisfy this condition, it is proposed to use a road side unit (RSU) cooperation method when the eavesdropper has better channel conditions than the legitimate user to scatter the coded packets from multiple RSUs. The aim is to reduce the probability that the eavesdropper receives the sufficient number of coded packets and recover the source data before the legitimate user. An optimisation framework which jointly selects the RQ code rate at the AL and Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) at the physical (PHY) layer to ensure the secure data transmission by allowing the user to decode the file with a certain probability of decoding success while minimising the intercept probability at the eavesdropper is presented. To evaluate the proposed system, a realistic end-to-end system level simulator is developed.

There are many possible applications, in fields as smart cities, home automation, smart buildings, agriculture, automated metering, logistic, industrial automation, among others. Such a wide range of applications resulted in various technological solutions in order to enable Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, in which we highlight those for wide area networks. In that sense, two widely used sub-GHz protocols for Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) communications are: Long Range (LoRa), using the upper layers defined by Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN); and IEEE 802.15.4g, using the upper layers defined by IPv6 over the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6TiSCH). While LoRaWAN is a well-known and widespread protocol, 6TiSCH offers IPv6 connectivity to LPWA networks and is used in important standards such as Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Network (Wi-SUN). This paper aims at determining how well each protocol scales, analyzing different aspects such as packet loss, delay, and the maximum number of nodes per square area. In order to achieve such results, computer simulations are performed using open-source simulators. The obtained results demonstrate that the best scalability depends on which scenarios are considered. For scenarios with multiple gateways requiring low latency or low packet transmission rates, LoRaWAN demonstrates better results. However, in scenarios with high packet transmission rates and where the latency is not a major concern, 6TiSCH is more appropriate. Moreover, even in the best case, the latency associated with the LoRaWAN technology may be considerably smaller than associated with 6TiSCH. Such novelty results are obtained in a fair and realistic way and, noting that both technologies could be used to build LPWA networks, it can help system designers to decide between the two technologies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","6LoWPAN; 6TiSCH; LoRaWAN; Simulation; TSCH","Automation; IEEE Standards; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Low power electronics; Packet networks; Titanium compounds; 6LoWPAN; 6TiSCH; Channel hopping; Long range wide area network; Low Power; Simulation; Slotted channels; Time-slotted channel hopping; Upper layer; Wide-area networks; Wide area networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122451542

These malicious codes are sometimes found in new forms, but in many cases they are modified from existing malicious codes. Since there are too many threatening malicious codes that are being continuously generated for human analysis, various studies to efficiently detect, classify, and analyze are essential. There are two main ways to analyze malicious code. First, static analysis is a technique to identify malicious behaviors by analyzing the structure of malicious codes or specific binary patterns at the code level. The second is a dynamic analysis technique that uses virtualization tools to build an environment in a virtual machine and executes malicious code to analyze malicious behavior. The method used to analyze malicious codes in this paper is a static analysis technique. Although there is a lot of information that can be obtained from dynamic analysis, there is a disadvantage that it can be analyzed normally only when the environment in which each malicious code is executed is matched. However, since the method proposed in this paper tracks and analyzes the execution stream of the code, static analysis is performed, but the effect of dynamic analysis can be expected.The core idea of this paper is to express the malicious code as a 25 ☓ 25 pixel image using 25 API categories selected. The interaction and frequency of the API is made into a 25 ☓ 25 pixel image based on a matrix using RGB values. When analyzing the malicious code, the Euclidean distance algorithm is applied to the generated image to measure the color similarity, and the similarity of the mutual malicious behavior is calculated based on the final Euclidean distance value. As a result, as a result of comparing the similarity calculated by the proposed method with the similarity calculated by the existing similarity calculation method, the similarity was calculated to be 5-10% higher on average. The method proposed in this study spends a lot of time deriving results because it analyzes, visualizes, and calculates the similarity of the visualized sample. Therefore, it takes a lot of time to analyze a huge number of malicious codes. A large amount of malware can be analyzed through follow-up studies, and improvements are needed to study the accuracy according to the size of the data set. © 2022, Strojarski Facultet.

An advanced microgrid concept is networked microgrids, or multi-microgrids, formed by a group of microgrids. They provide reliability, resilience and robustness to the grid, reducing operational costs. Nevertheless, problems related to variability and uncertainty of these renewables impose remarkable difficulties to control and operate multiple microgrids at distribution and transmission level. Different solutions have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks. Moreover, some contributions suggest coordinated control, architectures and energy management strategies to be applied at networked microgrids. This paper identifies and analyzes aggregated and/or coordinated renewable-based microgrids being able to provide ancillary services, market participation and communication. These characteristics increase grid flexibility and reliability, promoting the variable renewable energy integration.

This paper proposes a non-fragile hybrid-triggered control design for networked positive switched systems to deal with the faults and cyber attacks. Bernoulli distribution is employed for describing cyber attacks. Based on the property of cyber attacks, a hybrid-triggered strategy is introduced. The corresponding hybrid-triggered mechanism consists of time- and event-triggered schemes. The event-triggering condition is established in a linear form. By combining a matrix decomposition approach and switched co-positive Lyapunov functions, a non-fragile hybrid-triggered controller is designed for positive switched systems with actuator faults. Then, a stochastic hybrid control strategy is used for the systems subject to stochastic cyber attacks. Under the hybrid-triggered controller, the systems can resist the risk from the attacks and actuator faults. Meanwhile, the risk of communication congestion from the limited bandwidth is reduced by virtue of the hybrid-triggered control strategy. All the presented conditions can be solved via linear programming. Finally, two examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the designed controller. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cyber attacks; Hybrid-triggered control; Networked positive switched systems","Actuators; Computer crime; Controllers; Crime; Linear programming; Lyapunov functions; Network security; Networked control systems; Stochastic systems; Actuator fault; Condition; Hybrid-triggered control; Measurements of; Networked positive switched system; Non-fragile; State measurements; Stochastics; Switched system; Systems performance; Cyber attacks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118864303

Albeit, the cloud environment is vulnerable to various sorts of attacks. So, recognizing malicious software is one of the principal challenges in cloud security governance. Intrusion detection system (IDS) has turned to the most generally utilized element of computer system security that asserts the cloud from diverse sorts of attacks and threats. As evident, no systematic literature review exists that focuses on cloud computing usage within IDS processes. The previous investigations had not considered the statistical analysis method. Hence, this paper examined the IDS mechanisms in cloud computing systematically. Twenty-two articles have been obtained using defined filters divided into four sections: hypervisor-based IDS, network-based IDS, machine learning-based IDS, and hybrid IDS. The comparison is performed depending on the outcomes illustrated in the investigations. It demonstrates that IDS precision, inclusiveness, overhead, and reaction time have been discussed in many studies. Simultaneously, less attention has been paid to cost-sensitivity, functioning, attack tolerance, and intrusion facing.

For performance measures, these algorithms have been tested on nine sensor devices over N-BaIoT datasets to measure the security and accuracy of the intrusion detection system.

However, in areas where public ground networks do not provide sufficient coverage or are destroyed by disasters, the rapid backhaul of monitoring data from emergency sites is difficult. Due to the urgent demand for data collection in such areas, we propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided emergency environmental monitoring system using a LoRa mesh networking approach, which can quickly build a large range of wireless communication networks suitable for small data transmission. First, we designed a LoRa-based mesh network protocol by using a custom slotted ALOHA medium access mechanism. Second, we designed and implemented a custom software and hardware platform of the monitoring system. The system adopts a communication mode, including multiple sensor nodes (SNs), multiple relay nodes (RNs), a gateway (GW), and a network server. Finally, we demonstrated the performance of the protocol and the system by in-lab and outdoor tests. The results show that when data rate is 0.293 kb/s, the line-of-sight 1-hop transmission distance is more than 10 km, and the 1-hop transmission delay is less than 6 s; the end-to-end delay has an upper bound, which can meet the real-time requirement of emergency response; the least upper bound of throughput per slot of our mesh protocol is much higher than that of LoRaWAN.

It also affects the security of endpoint devices. An infected endpoint device can take part in aggressive or slow distributed denial of service attacks globally. Polymorphic malware has rendered traditional signature-based detection ineffective. Hence the efforts to identify malware have been focused on behavioral modeling to identify and classify malware. This behavioral identification paved the way for artificial intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity. AI can detect a zero-day attack and malware, but it suffers from several false positives. This article presents an extensive analysis of traditional and AI-based methods for malware detection and related challenges. AI is vulnerable to attacks, such as dataset poisoning and adversarial data input, which can reduce model accuracy and increase false negatives. AI has helped to improve malware detection and reduce manual work through automation of feature extraction and feature selection. It is also beneficial to create models that are less prone to malware variations and capture the malicious behavior holistically.

However, its extensive application has rendered security problems, such as the privacy of sensitive data, increasingly serious. Encryption provides an effective and important means of protecting data privacy in the IoT. Because of resource limitations, to achieve high efficiency IoT devices require an encryption scheme that ensures that the encryption phase does not incur a heavy data transmission overhead. By virtue of its many advantages, the use of public-key encryption in current applications is widespread. Identity-based public-key encryption (IBE) removes the obstacle raised by the sophisticated certificate management required by other schemes, and its efficiency renders it more suitable for application in the IoT. However, a problem that needs to be solved in IBE is the revocation of a user whose private key may have been exposed. In this article, we present an efficient and practical IBE scheme having a revocation functionality to preserve data privacy in IoT applications. Elements in the system, such as sensors and actuators, can exchange encrypted data directly or via a cloud server. If a private key is compromised, the private key generator can revoke its user. The security of our proposed scheme can be proved based on SM9 encryption and the bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem. © 2014 IEEE.","Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) problem; Cloud; Identity-based encryption (IBE); Internet of Things (IoT); Revocation; SM9; Time key","Data privacy; Efficiency; Public key cryptography; Certificate management; Encryption schemes; Identity Based Encryption; Internet of thing (IOT); Private key generators; Public-key encryption; Resource limitations; Sensors and actuators; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114723061

However, edge-cloud computing systems are composed of various hardware facilities, leading to difficulties in hardware control and management. With network slicing, underlying resource sharing among multiple slice users is allowed, leading to potential attacks to the slice formulation processes and malicious usage of network slices that may result in inefficient resource utilization of the system. To address the aforementioned network slice security issue, we first propose a new systematic framework, named software-defined edge-cloud computing (SD-ECC), which applies standard software to control the hardware infrastructure regardless of vendor variations. With SD-ECC, resource slices are formulated by including storage and computational resources provided by edge and cloud servers. Then, we study an optimal slicing-based resource orchestration problem by considering slice-initiated attacks as possible adversaries, which includes both interslice and intraslice resource orchestrations. A secure slicing-based resource orchestration (SS-RO) algorithm is designed by minimizing the delay and resource utilization simultaneously to mitigate the impacts of the slice-initiated attacks, where the Benders decomposition is employed to obtain the interslice orchestration outcome, and a quadratic transformation method is applied to derive the intraslice orchestration solution.

In this context, in which IoT users react to protect their devices against the threat, a zero-sum one-sided partially observable stochastic game (OS-POSG) model is proposed in which a defender strategically places honeypots in the IoT network in order to deceive attacker's actions and mitigate the botnet propagation. No player (attacker and defender) observes the opponent's action but, realistically, the attacker - who is the maximizer - has a perfect knowledge of the state of the network while the defender - who is the minimizer - only is informed of the decisions of IoT users. The objective is to find an optimal deception strategy for the defender that better limits from above the proportion of infected IoT devices. We show in numerous simulations the impact of the partial observation and of the strategic defender's action on the particular metrics which are the maximum proportion of infected IoT devices during the botnet propagation and the time to botnet extinction in the IoT network. © 2014 IEEE.","Botnet; epidemic; stochastic game","Botnet; Game theory; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Deception strategies; Game-theoretic model; Honeypots; Internet of thing (IOT); IOT networks; Partial observation; Stochastic game; Zero sums; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107214700

To solve the current security problems and functional requirements, we propose a multifunctional and multidimensional secure DA scheme to strike the balance between data availability and privacy. First, we design a Chinese remainder theorem conversion method with the counter to encode multidimensional data into large integers, which can be operated by linear homomorphic encryption schemes. Then, we introduce a multifunctional data analysis method supporting diversified aggregation functions, including linear, polynomial, and continuous functions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and resistance against false data injection attacks. The experimental results show that the supported max dimension of one ciphertext in our scheme is at least twice that of existing schemes.

Such brilliant automation of mundane tasks requires a considerable amount of user data in digital format, which, in turn, makes IoT networks an open source of personally identifiable information data for malicious attackers to steal, manipulate, and perform nefarious activities. A huge interest has been developed over the past years in applying machine learning (ML)-assisted approaches in the IoT security space. However, the assumption in many current works is that big training data are widely available and transferable to the main server because data are born at the edge and are generated continuously by IoT devices. This is to say that classic ML works on the legacy set of entire data located on a central server, which makes it the least preferred option for domains with privacy concerns on user data. To address this issue, we propose the federated-learning (FL)-based anomaly detection approach to proactively recognize intrusion in IoT networks using decentralized on-device data. Our approach uses federated training rounds on gated recurrent units (GRUs) models and keeps the data intact on local IoT devices by sharing only the learned weights with the central server of FL. Also, the approach's ensembler part aggregates the updates from multiple sources to optimize the global ML model's accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the classic/centralized machine learning (non-FL) versions in securing the privacy of user data and provides an optimal accuracy rate in attack detection. © 2014 IEEE.","Federated learning (FL); gated recurrent units (GRUs); Internet of Things (IoT); recurrent neural networks (RNNs); security","Anomaly detection; Data privacy; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Attack detection; Detection approach; Human intervention; Internet of thing (IOT); Optimal accuracy; Personally identifiable information; Physical devices; Privacy concerns; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105874470

This IoT-oriented and cloud-assisted healthcare system enables the doctor to monitor the patient's health state to respond to the paroxysmal diseases in real time. Considering the sensitivity of the patient's privacy, it is necessary to encrypt the cloud-stored health data to prevent the semi-trusted cloud and unauthorized users from accessing them. However, the encrypted health data stored in the cloud brings inconvenience to the retrieval for the data user. In addition, the expensive computational consumption also raises the challenge to the resource-constrained devices in the patient and doctor sides. To support efficient ciphertext retrieval and cope with the performance challenge, in this article we propose a lightweight attribute-based searchable encryption (LABSE) scheme, which realizes fine-grained access control and keyword search, while reducing the computational overhead for the resource-constrained devices. We rigorously prove the semantic security of the proposed LABSE scheme, and analyze other security properties to response the security requirements under the healthcare scenario.

This leads to launch several potential attacks by an adversary, such as main-in-middle, impersonation, drones hijacking, replay attacks, etc. Moreover, anonymity and untraceability are two crucial security properties that need to be maintained in battlefield surveillance communication environment.

It first divides the IPv6 address space into different regions according to the structural information of a set of known addresses. Then, 6Graph maps the addresses of each region into undirected graphs and conducts the density-based graph cutting for address clustering to mine IPv6 address patterns and detect the misclassified addresses iteratively. Besides, we exploit the random IPv6 target generation based on Hamming distance without additional and complicated target selection. Experiments on 11 large-scale candidate datasets show that the address patterns of 6Graph have a higher seed density than the existing methods. Further results over real-world networks indicate that 6Graph can achieve 12.6%–35.8% hit rates on the candidate datasets, which is an 8.8%–275.0% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in Internet-wide scanning. © 2021","Internet-wide scanning; IPv6; Outlier detection; Pattern mining","Anomaly detection; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Hamming distance; Internet protocols; Iterative methods; Large dataset; Scanning; Address space; Cyber security; Graph theoretic approach; Graph-theoretic methods; Hit rate; Internet-wide scanning; Ipv6; Ipv6 address; Pattern mining; Structural information; Data mining",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121932849

In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), most ML-enabled IDS approaches use centralized approaches where IoT devices share their data with data centers for further analysis. To mitigate privacy concerns associated with centralized approaches, in recent years the use of Federated Learning (FL) has attracted a significant interest in different sectors, including healthcare and transport systems. However, the development of FL-enabled IDS for IoT is in its infancy, and still requires research efforts from various areas, in order to identify the main challenges for the deployment in real-world scenarios. In this direction, our work evaluates a FL-enabled IDS approach based on a multiclass classifier considering different data distributions for the detection of different attacks in an IoT scenario. In particular, we use three different settings that are obtained by partitioning the recent ToN_IoT dataset according to IoT devices’ IP address and types of attack. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of different aggregation functions according to such setting by using the recent IBMFL framework as FL implementation.

For example, the Mirai botnet infected almost 65,000 devices in its first 20 h. With the prevalence of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phones and devices on the networks today, the attacker could easily target and recruit these IoT devices as bots. Conventional network security measures do not provide adequate attack prevention, detection, and mitigation for these widely distributed IoT devices. This paper presents microVNF, a Virtualized Network Function (VNF) that leverages the programmable data plane feature on the edge switch. Based on knowledge gained from the Mirai botnet incident and following the defense-in-depth principle, microVNF protects IoT devices against SIP DDoS attacks in two stages: before and after infection. Prior to infection, it protects against SIP scanning, enumeration, and dictionary attacks. After infection, microVNF blocks botnet registration attempts to the command-and-control (CNC) server, thereby preventing the botnet from receiving commands sent from the CNC server, and detects and mitigates botnet SIP DDoS attacks. We conducted six experiments that involved using popular attack tools against microVNF, and it successfully performed deep-packet inspection of unencrypted SIP packets so as to track anomalies from a typical SIP state-machine. In this use case, besides providing physical connectivity to the IoT devices, the edge switch containing microVNF also provides the first line of defense in stopping malicious packets from propagating upstream to the core network. In addition to securing SIP, the microVNF approach can be adapted to other text-based, application-layer protocols such as HTTP and SMTP. MicroVNF leverages the native capability of programmable data planes without depending on external devices, thereby making this approach practical for securing edge-computing environments against application-layer attacks. © 2021","DDoS; Dictionary attack; Edge computing; IoT; P4; SIP; SIPVicious; VNF","Botnet; Denial-of-service attack; Edge computing; Internet protocols; Network security; Botnets; Data planes; Data-plane; DDoS; Dictionary attack; Edge computing; Network functions; Session Initiation Protocols; Sipvicious; Virtualized network function; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121325094

In each periodic pulse point, some parts of low energy states (LS nodes, LI nodes) will be converted into the normal energy states (S nodes, I nodes) to control the number of susceptible nodes and infected nodes. This paper first analyzes the local stability of the SIALS‐P model by Floquet theory. Then, a suitable comparison system is given by comparing theorem to analyze the stability of malware‐free T‐period solution and the persistence of malware transmission.

With Industry 4.0 being unable to address and meet increased drive of personalization, the term Industry 5.0 was coined for addressing personalized manufacturing and empowering humans in manufacturing processes. The onset of the term Industry 5.0 is observed to have various views of how it is defined and what constitutes the reconciliation between humans and machines. This serves as the motivation of this paper in identifying and analyzing the various themes and research trends of what Industry 5.0 is using text mining tools and techniques. Toward this, the abstracts of 196 published papers based on the keyword “Industry 5.0” search in IEEE, science direct and MDPI data bases were extracted. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed for further analysis to apply text mining techniques of key terms extraction and frequency analysis. Further topic mining i.e., unsupervised machine learning method was used for exploring the data. It is observed that the terms artificial intelligence (AI), big data, supply chain, digital transformation, machine learning, internet of things (IoT), are among the most often used and among several enablers that have been identified by researchers to drive Industry 5.0. Five major themes of Industry 5.0 addressing, supply chain evaluation and optimization, enterprise innovation and digitization, smart and sustainable manufacturing, transformation driven by IoT, AI, and Big Data, and Human-machine connectivity were classified among the published literature, highlighting the research themes that can be further explored. It is observed that the theme of Industry 5.0 as a gateway towards human machine connectivity and co-existence is gaining more interest among the research community in the recent years. © 2022 by the authors.

The increased number of interconnected IoT devices, their limited computational power, and the evolving sophistication of cyber security threats, results in increased security challenges for the IoT ecosystem. The diversity of IoT devices, and the variety of QoS requirements among several domains of IoT application, impose considerable challenges in designing and implementing a robust IoT security solution. The aim of this paper is to present an efficient, robust, and easy-to-use system, for IoT cyber security operators. Following a by-design security approach, the proposed system is a platform comprising four distinct yet cooperating components; a distributed AI-enhanced detection of potential threats and anomalies mechanisms, an AI-based generation of effective mitigation strategies according to the severity of detected threats, a system for the verification of SDN routing decisions along with networkand resource-related policies, and a comprehensive and intuitive security status visualization and analysis. The distributed anomaly detection scheme implementing multiple AI-powered agents is deployed across the IoT network nodes aiming to efficiently monitor the entire network infrastructure. Network traffic data are fed to the AI agents, which process consecutive traffic samples from the network in a time series analysis manner, where consecutive time windows framing the traffic of the surrounding nodes are processed by a graph neural network algorithm. Any detected anomalies are handled by a mitigation engine employing a distributed neural network algorithm, which exploits the recorded anomalous events and deploys appropriate responses for optimal threat mitigation.

With the explosive growth in the use of IoT devices, it is essential to design effective and efficient channel access schemes for the 802.15.4 networks. In order to improve channel contention efficiency (CCE), which is defined as the number of times of successfully gaining the channel per unit of backoff time whereby throughput is improved, the scheme of enhancing channel contention efficiency (ECCE) has been proposed to jointly optimize the three key parameters of macMinBe, macMaxBe and macMaxCsmaBackoffs in the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA-CA) mechanism in the 802.15.4 standard. A novel Markov chain was developed to model the CSMA-CA mechanism, which yielded the expected number of failures in gaining the channel, the expected number of backoff periods and the expected number of backoffs when a node intended to transmit a packet. These statistics resulted in CCE. An optimization problem that maximized the CCE with respect to the above-mentioned three key parameters was formulated. The solution to the optimization problem led to the optimal parameter values, which were applied in the ECCE scheme.

To address these issues, we introduce an edge-assisted decentralized authentication (EADA) architecture, which provides secure and more communication-efficient authentication by enabling an authentication server to delegate its authentication capability to distributed edge nodes (ENs) such as roadside units (RSUs) and base stations (BSs). Under the architecture, we propose a threshold mutual authentication protocol that supports fast handover, which involves two scenarios, Auth-I and Auth-II. Auth-I only happens once when a vehicle tries to access the network for the first time, while Auth-II happens when a vehicle seamlessly roams between two ENs, i.e., handover. Specifically, for Auth-I, each vehicle can be cooperatively authenticated by t out of n ENs with identity-based signature techniques to obtain an authentication token and the involved ENs can be efficiently authenticated in a batch by the vehicle. For Auth-II, the vehicle can utilize the token as its private credential to achieve fast handover based on identity-based signature without interacting with multiple ENs, which further reduces the authentication delay significantly. In addition, we design a flexible method to support dynamic joining and leaving of ENs without the assistance of a trusted center. We demonstrate that the proposed protocol is secure and efficient through security analysis and performance evaluation. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","edge; mutual authentication; threshold signature; Vehicular networks","Authentication; Cryptography; Internet protocols; Network architecture; Network security; Authentication architecture; Authentication delays; Decentralised; Edge; Edge nodes; Fast handovers; Identity based signature; Mutual authentication; Threshold signature; Vehicular networks; Vehicles",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124671220

The formulation of the FDIA vector has attracted many researchers to propose detection algorithms. However, neither the attack formulation nor the proposed detection algorithms have been experimentally proven or validated. In this article, a framework for developing cybersecurity test beds that evaluate FDIA vectors for utility-scale distributed energy resources (DERs) and SE in real-time is proposed and implemented. The test bed is a combination of: 1) simulation models of utility-scale DER and distribution systems using OPAL-RT; 2) intelligent electronic devices (SEL-351S, SEL-311C, and SEL-3355); 3) network devices; and 4) graphical user interface (LabVIEW). The combination of actual devices, modeled systems, and cyber-physical interfaces adds realistic constraints, such as sampling error, network jitter, and data time alignment that exist during actual power system operations. Using the test bed framework, results show that the onset of the FDIA against a state estimator is experimentally detectable. Next, the test bed is used to expose an unknown vulnerability of existing phase-locked loop (PLL) techniques by presenting a new class of attack that causes PLL reporting of false phase angle and frequency values to the DER controllers. This type of attack would, then, induce the DERs to perform an adverse control action. In this article, a new detection algorithm based on a Kalman filter is evaluated to detect this type of PLL attack. A detailed evaluation of various attack scenarios is presented. The results indicate the benefits of employing this type of test bed framework to improve the development of cybersecurity defenses for realistic inverter-based DER environments. © 2021 IEEE.","Cybersecurity; distributed energy resources (DERs); state estimation (SE)","Cybersecurity; Energy resources; Graphical user interfaces; Network security; Phase locked loops; Signal detection; State estimation; Attack vector; Cyber security; Detection algorithm; Distributed energy resource; Distributed Energy Resources; False data injection attacks; State estimation; State Estimators; Test bed; Theoretical study; Equipment testing",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124614564

The quickest detection algorithm aims at minimizing the worst case detection delays (WDDs) of cyberattacks, subject to an upper bound of the false alarm rate. Since power-grid state transitions could be caused by either cyberattacks or sudden change in loads or grid configurations, we propose to distinguish between an FDIA and a sudden system change by using a time-varying dynamic model, which can accurately capture the dynamic state transitions due to changes in system configurations. A dynamic state estimation algorithm is developed to estimate and track the time-varying and nonstationary power-grid states. The quickest detection algorithm is developed by analyzing the statistical properties of dynamic state estimations, such that the algorithm minimizes the WDD while accurately distinguishing FDIA from sudden system changes. A Markov-chain-based analytical model is used to identify the detector's parameter and quantify its performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can accurately detect and remove false data injections or system faults with minimum delays.

Such attacks result in financial loss and data breaches, which urge a consequential need to secure IIoT infrastructure. To combat the threats in the IIoT environment, we proposed a deep-learning SDN-enabled intelligent framework. A hybrid classifier is used for threat detection purposes, i.e., Cu-LSTMGRU + Cu-BLSTM. The proposed model achieved a better detection accuracy with low false-positive rate. We have conducted 10-fold cross-validation to show the unbiasdness of the results. The proposed scheme results are compared with Cu-DNNLSTM and Cu-DNNGRU classifiers, which were tested and trained on the same dataset. We have further compared the proposed model with other existing standard classifiers for a thorough performance evaluation. Results achieved by our proposed scheme are impressive with respect to speed efficiency, F1 score, accuracy, precision, and other evaluation metrics. © 2022 by the authors.

IoT offers several innovation capabilities and features, but they are also prone to security vulnerabilities and risks. These vulnerabilities must be studied to protect these technologies from being exploited by others. Cryptography techniques and approaches are commonly used to address and deal with security vulnerabilities. In general, the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) is an application layer protocol vulnerable to various known and unknown security issues. One possible solution is to introduce an encryption algorithm into the MQTT communication protocol for secure transmission. This study aims to solve the security problem of IoT traffic by using a secure and lightweight communication proxy. The strategy behind this communication broker acts as a network gateway providing secure transaction keys to all IoT nodes in the network. This task uses a java servlet and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) algorithm to generate identity encryption keys in a component-based web transaction infrastructure. This approach encrypts the data before it is sent via the MQTT protocol to secure the communication channel and raise the security device and network transactions. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Efficient authentication and secure data transmission are the influential impediments of these networks that need to be addressed to maintain credence among clients, healthcare specialists, pharmacologists, and other associated entities. To address the authentication and data privacy issues in smart healthcare, in this paper we propose a lightweight hybrid deep learning protocol to achieve security and privacy. To achieve better results, we enabled the decentralized authentication of legitimate patient wearable devices to minimize computation cost, authentication time, and communication overheads with the help of an ML technique to predicate and forward the authentication attributes of patient wearable devices to the next concerned trusted authority, when it is shifted from region to another region. Simulation up-shots of the ML scheme exhibited extraordinary security features with the cost‐effective validation of legal patient wearable devices accompanied by worthwhile communication function-alities compared with previous work. However, the application of IoT‐based medical devices and managing such a broad, sophisticated medical IoT system on standard Single Cloud platforms (CP) would be extremely tough.

The adoption of such systems is revolutionized by a propelling advancements in IoT and Blockchain technologies. Owing to technological advancement in IoT sensors market, innovations in HCS to monitor patients health status have motivated many countries to strength their efforts to support their citizens with such care delivery systems under the directives of a physician who has access to patient’s data. Nevertheless, secure data sharing is a principal patient’s concern to be comfort to use such systems. Current HCS are not able to provide reassuring security policies. For that, one of our focus in this work, is to provide security countermeasures, likewise cost-efficient solution for HCS by integrating storage model based on Blockchain and Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS). Blockchain technology is an emerging solution in pharmaceutical industry and starts to take place for HCS and allows HealthCare providers to track connected devices and control access to shared data, hence protecting patients’ privacy. Furthermore, the addition of Edge and Fog computing has improved HCS to react in real-time and enhance their reliability. A variety of communication protocols can connect sensor devices to edge/Fog layer and the best choice will depend upon connectivity requirements: range, bandwidth, power, interoperability, security, and reliability. Instead, systems efficiency would decline and hurt if communication protocol is inconsistent. LoRa (Long Range) communications technology is emerging as the leader among Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) entering the IoT domain benefiting from many features such as long-range distances and low power consumption. This work proposes LoRaChainCare, an architecture model for HCS which combines the technologies Blockchain, Fog/Edge computing, and the LoRa communication protocol.

IoT applications often require the presence of many technologies such as cloud computing and fog computing, which have led to serious challenges to security.

Several artificial intelligence (AI)-based security solutions have been presented in recent years, including intrusion detection systems (IDS). Feature selection (FS) approaches are required for the development of intelligent analytic tools that need data pretreatment and machinelearning algorithm-performance enhancement. By reducing the number of selected features, FS aims to improve classification accuracy. This article presents a new FS method through boosting the performance of Gorilla Troops Optimizer (GTO) based on the algorithm for bird swarms (BSA). This BSA is used to boost performance exploitation of GTO in the newly developed GTO-BSA because it has a strong ability to find feasible regions with optimal solutions. As a result, the quality of the final output will increase, improving convergence. GTO-BSA’s performance was evaluated using a variety of performance measures on four IoT-IDS datasets: NSL-KDD, CICIDS-2017, UNSW-NB15 and BoT-IoT. The results were compared to those of the original GTO, BSA, and several state-of-the-art techniques in the literature.

To reduce smart vehicle accidents and detect malicious attacks in vehicular networks, several researchers have presented machine learning (ML)-based models for intrusion detection in IoT networks. However, a proficient and real-time faster algorithm is needed to detect malicious attacks in IoV. This article proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for cyber attack detection in IoV.

The performance of the proposed model is analyzed by using two datasets—a combined DDoS dataset that contains CIC DoS, CI-CIDS 2017, and CSE-CIC-IDS 2018, and a car-hacking dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher attack detection accuracy of 99.5% and 99.9% for DDoS and car hacks, respectively.

To protect data privacy and device availability, identity authentication technology has been applied to the IoT environment. However, although scholars have designed a variety of authentication protocols for the IoT environment, the resource costs of these protocols are still expensive for resource-constrained devices. In particular, when the frequent upgrade of computer hardware has led to a gradual increase in the key length of the cryptosystem, IoT devices are hard to keep up with the upgrade speed because of the balance between cost and tasks. Although the storage space has increased in recent years, the computational and communication capabilities are still limited by some physical factors, such as energy, power, and communication link bandwidth. To improve the situation, this article proposes an anonymous authentication protocol suitable for IoT devices with current hardware performance, which is based on elliptic curve and signcryption techniques. Compared to other protocols, our protocol further reduces the communication and computing cost of the client devices while ensuring security requirements. Thus, we formally prove its theoretical security under the random oracle model and use simulation experiments to verify that the protocol can effectively reduce the resource requirements. © 2021 IEEE.","Authentication; Elliptic curve cryptography; Internet of Things; Privacy; Protocols; Security; Smart meters","Authentication; Data privacy; Digital storage; Geometry; Internet protocols; Public key cryptography; Anonymous authentication; Authentication protocols; Authentication technology; Identity authentication; Key lengths; Privacy; Resource costs; Resourceconstrained devices; Security; Storage spaces; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124325068

Due to the diversity and rapid updates of the attack methods used by attackers, traditional defense mechanisms have been challenged. In this context, a more effective method to predict vulnerabilities in network systems is considered an urgent need to protect network security. In this paper, we propose a formal modeling and analysis approach based on Petri net vulnerability exploitation. We used the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)-2021-3711 vulnerability source code to build a model. A patch model was built to address the problems of this model. Finally, the time injected by the actual attacker and the time simulated by the software were calculated separately. The results showed that the simulation time was shorter than the actual attack time, and ultra-real-time simulation could be achieved. By modeling the network system with this method, the model can be found to arrive at an illegitimate state according to the structure of Petri nets themselves and thus discover unknown vulnerabilities.

Using traditional knowledge-based or possession-based authentication with additional invasive interactions raises users concerns regarding security and usefulness. State-of-the-art schemes for trusted devices with physical unclonable functions (PUF) have complex enrollment processes. We propose a scheme based on a challenge response protocol with a trusted Internet of Things (IoT) autonomous device for hands-free scenarios (i.e., with no additional user interaction), integrated with smart home behavior for continuous authentication. The protocol was validated with automatic formal security analysis. A proof of concept with websockets presented an average response time of 383 ms for mutual authentication using a 6-message protocol with a simple enrollment process. We performed hands-free activity recognition of a specific user, based on smart home testbed data from a 2-month period, obtaining an accuracy of 97% and a recall of 81%.

One of the most vulnerable aspects of smart homes is access control. Recent advances in IoT have led to several access control models being developed or adapted to IoT from other domains, with few specifically designed to meet the challenges of smart homes. Most of these models use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) models. As of now, it is not clear what the advantages and disadvantages of ABAC over RBAC are in general, and in the context of smart-home IoT in particular. In this paper, we introduce HABACα, an attribute-based access control model for smart-home IoT. We formally define HABACα and demonstrate its features through two use-case scenarios and a proof-of-concept implementation. Furthermore, we present an analysis of HABACα as compared to the previously published EGRBAC (extended generalized role-based access control) model for smart-home IoT by first describing approaches for constructing HABACα specification from EGRBAC and vice versa in order to compare the theoretical expressiveness power of these models, and second, analyzing HABACα and EGRBAC models against standard criteria for access control models.

As load-frequency control methods, both aggregated distributed energy sources (ADES) and artificial intelligence techniques provide flexible solution strategies to mitigate the frequency deviation of power grids. This paper proposes a load-frequency control strategy of ADES-based reinforcement learning under the consideration of reducing the impact of denial of service (DoS) attacks. Reinforcement learning is used to evaluate the pros and cons of the proposed frequency control strategy. The entire evaluation process is realized by the approximation of convex neural networks. Convex neural networks are used to convert the nonlinear optimization problems of reinforcement learning for long-term performance into the corresponding convex optimization problems. Thus, the local optimum is avoided, the optimization process of the strategy utility function is accelerated, and the response ability of controllers is improved. The stability of power grids and the convergence of convex neural networks under the proposed frequency control strategy are studied by constructing Lyapunov functions to obtain the sufficient conditions for the steady states of ADES and the weight convergence of actor–critic networks. The article uses the IEEE14, IEEE57, and IEEE118 bus testing systems to verify the proposed strategy. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed frequency control strategy can effectively reduce the frequency deviation of power grids under DoS attacks. © 2022 by the authors.

Commonalities between the emerging definitions of digital twins describe them as digital or cyber environments that are bidirectionally-linked to their physical or real-life replica to enable simulation and data-centric decision making. Studies have started to investigate their role in the digitalization of asset delivery, including the management of built assets at different levels within the building and infrastructure sectors. However, questions persist regarding their actual applications and implementation chal-lenges, including their integration with other digital technologies (i.e., building information modeling, virtual and augmented reality, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing). Within the built environment context, this study seeks to analyze the definitions and characteristics of a digital twin, its interactions with other digital technologies used in built asset delivery and operation, and its applications and challenges. To achieve this aim, the research utilizes a thorough literature review and semi-structured interviews with ten industry experts. The literature review explores the merits and the relevance of digital twins relative to existing digital technologies and highlights potential applications and challenges for their implementation. The data from the semi-structured interviews are classified into five themes: definitions and enablers of digital twins, applications and benefits, implementation challenges, existing practical applications, and future development.

With the increase in industrial equipment (e.g., smart mobile terminals, sensors, and other embedded devices) in the Internet of Things and the advent of Industry 4.0, there has been an explosion of data generated that is characterized by a high volume but small size. How to manage and protect sensitive private data in data sharing has become an urgent issue for enterprises. Traditional data sharing and storage relies on trusted third-party platforms or distributed cloud storage, but these approaches run the risk of single-node failure, and third parties and cloud storage providers can be vulnerable to attacks that can lead to data theft. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain-based secure data transfer scheme for enterprises in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT). We store raw data in the IIoT in the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) network after encryption and store the Keyword-index table we designed in Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, and enterprises share the data by querying the Keyword-index table. We use Fabric’s channel mechanism combined with our designed Chaincode to achieve privacy protection and efficient data transmission while using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to ensure data integrity. Finally, we performed security analysis and experiments on the proposed scheme, and the results show that overall the data transfer performance in the IPFS network is generally better than the traditional network, In the case of transferring 5 MB file size data, the transmission speed and latency of IPFS are 19.23 mb/s and 0.26 s, respectively, and the IPFS network is almost 4 times faster than the TCP/IP network while taking only a quarter of the time, which is more advantageous when transferring small files, such as data in the IIOT. In addition, our scheme outperforms the blockchain systems mainly used today in terms of both throughput, latency, and system overhead. The average throughput of our solution can reach 110 tps (transactions are executed per second), and the minimum throughput in experimental tests can reach 101 tps. © 2022 by the authors.","Chaincode; Data security sharing; Hyperledger Fabric blockchain; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); IPFS; Privacy-preserved","Cryptography; Data privacy; Data transfer; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Electronic document identification systems; Internet of things; Block-chain; Chain codes; Data security sharing; Data Sharing; Filesystem; Hyperledg fabric blockchain; Industrial internet of thing; Inter-planetary file system; Privacy-preserved; Systems networks; Blockchain; article; blockchain; cloud computing; data integrity; encryption; experimental test; information security; internet of things; privacy; theft; velocity",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123872454

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are representative examples applied widely in IDS. However, DNN models are becoming increasingly complex in model architectures with high resource computing in hardware requirements. In addition, it is difficult for humans to obtain explanations behind the decisions made by these DNN models using large IoT-based IDS datasets. Many proposed IDS methods have not been applied in practical deployments, because of the lack of explanation given to cybersecurity experts, to support them in terms of optimizing their decisions according to the judgments of the IDS models. This paper aims to enhance the attack detection performance of IDS with big IoT-based IDS datasets as well as provide explanations of machine learning (ML) model predictions. The proposed ML-based IDS method is based on the ensemble trees approach, including decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF) classifiers which do not require high computing resources for training models. In addition, two big datasets are used for the experimental evaluation of the proposed method, NF-BoT-IoT-v2, and NF-ToN-IoT-v2 (new versions of the original BoT-IoT and ToN-IoT datasets), through the feature set of the net flow meter. In addition, the IoTDS20 dataset is used for experiments. Furthermore, the SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) is applied to the eXplainable AI (XAI) methodology to explain and interpret the classification decisions of DT and RF models; this is not only effective in interpreting the final decision of the ensemble tree approach but also supports cybersecurity experts in quickly optimizing and evaluating the correctness of their judgments based on the explanations of the results. © 2022 by the authors.

Faces with this situation, drives a rising number of organizations across the world are showing a growing willingness to leverage the open exchange of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) for obtaining a full picture of the fast-evolving cyber threat situation and protecting themselves against cyber-attacks. However, modeling CTI is challenging due to the explicit and implicit relationships among CTI and the heterogeneity of cyber-threat infrastructure nodes involved in CTI. Owing to the limited labels of cyber threat infrastructure nodes involved in CTI, automatically identifying the threat type of infrastructure nodes for early warning is also challenging. To tackle these challenges, a practical system called HinCTI is developed for modeling cyber threat intelligence and identifying threat types. We first design a threat intelligence meta-schema to depict the semantic relatedness of infrastructure nodes. We then model cyber threat intelligence on heterogeneous information network (HIN), which can integrate various types of infrastructure nodes and rich relations among them. Following, we define a meta-path and meta-graph instances-based threat Infrastructure similarity (MIIS) measure between threat infrastructure nodes and present a MIIS measure-based heterogeneous graph convolutional network (GCN) approach to identify the threat types of infrastructure nodes involved in CTI. Moreover, through the hierarchical regularization strategy, our model can alleviate the problem of overfitting and achieve good results in the threat type identification of infrastructure nodes. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to model CTI on HIN for threat identification and propose a heterogeneous GCN-based approach for threat type identification of infrastructure nodes. With HinCTI, comprehensive experiments are conducted on real-world datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of threat type identification compared to the existing state-of-the-art baseline methods. Our work is beneficial to greatly relieve security analysts from heavy analysis work and efficiently protect organizations against cyber-attacks. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","Cyber threat intelligence; graph convolutional network; heterogeneous information network; threat infrastructure nodes; threat type identification","Computer crime; Convolution; Crime; Cybersecurity; Graph theory; Network security; Semantics; Convolutional networks; Cybe threat intelligence; Cyber threats; Graph convolutional network; Heterogeneous information; Heterogeneous information network; Information networks; Meta-graph; Threat infrastructure node; Threat type identification; Information services",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123600245

For this, Internet of Things (IoT) solutions contribute, with monitoring and remote control features, to automate these environments. However, these solutions can promote the dis-posal or replacement of outdated but still-needed legacy systems. Thus, a reference model that uses retrofit techniques to update pre-existing systems would be an alternative to enable smart building convergence. The lack of models that advocate this type of strategy provides an opportunity for the emergence of methods capable of filling this gap. Thus, this work presents a strategy for implementing monitoring, control, and communication resources to achieve smart building convergence in legacy building systems. This strategy consists of the use of retrofit techniques based on the adaptation of the SmartLVGrid metamodel. To validate this proposal, we developed hardware platforms and, respectively, their firmware to implement the premises established in a legacy building lighting circuit. The results obtained present a new possibility of implementing smart buildings from the retrofit of legacy infrastructures, as the pre-existing building lighting circuit obtained new functionalities and was preserved as much as possible. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, a model of remote computing scheme is presented, where three layers of computing nodes are put in place in order to optimize the computing and forwarding tasks. In this sense, a generic layout has been designed so as to easily achieve communications among the diverse layers by means of simple arithmetic operations, which may result in saving resources in all nodes involved. Traffic forwarding is undertaken by means of forwarding tables within network devices, which need to be searched upon in order to find the proper destination, and that process may be resource-consuming as the number of entries in such tables grow. However, the arithmetic framework proposed may speed up the traffic forwarding decisions as relaying on integer divisions and modular arithmetic, which may result more straightforward. Furthermore, two diverse approaches have been proposed to formally describe such a design by means of coding with Spin/Promela, or otherwise, by using an algebraic approach with Algebra of Communicating Processes (ACP), resulting in a explosion state for the former and a specified and verified model in the latter. © 2022 by the authors.

One of the most efficient approaches is unsupervised learning (UL), a sort of algorithms for analyzing and clustering unlabeled data; it allows identifying hidden patterns or performing data clustering over provided data without the need for human involvement. There is no prior knowledge of actual abnormalities when using UL methods in anomaly detection (AD); hence, a DL-intrusion detection system (IDS)-based on AD depends intensely on their assumption about the distribution of anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised AD Host-IDS for internet of things (IoT) based on adversarial training architecture using the generative adversarial network (GAN). Our proposed IDS, called ""EdgeIDS"", targets mostly IoT devices because of their limited functionality; IoT devices send and receive only specific data, not like traditional devices, such as servers or computers that exchange a wide range of data. We benchmarked our proposed ""EdgeIDS"" on the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTTset) dataset with five attack types, and our obtained results are promising, up to 0.99 in the ROC-AUC metric, and to just 0.035 in the ROC-EER metric.

Out of these, COVID-19 is viewed as the most critical and novel infection nowadays. The current investigation gives an effective framework for the monitoring and prediction of COVID-19 virus infection (C-19VI). To the best of our knowledge, no research work is focused on incorporating IoT technology for C-19 outspread over spatial–temporal patterns. Moreover, limited work has been done in the direction of prediction of C-19 in humans for controlling the spread of COVID-19. The proposed framework includes a four-level architecture for the expectation and avoidance of COVID-19 contamination. The presented model comprises COVID-19 Data Collection (C-19DC) level, COVID-19 Information Classification (C-19IC) level, COVID-19-Mining and Extraction (C-19ME) level, and COVID-19 Prediction and Decision Modeling (C-19PDM) level. Specifically, the presented model is used to empower a person/community to intermittently screen COVID-19 Fever Measure (C-19FM) and forecast it so that proactive measures are taken in advance. Additionally, for prescient purposes, the probabilistic examination of C-19VI is quantified as degree of membership, which is cumulatively characterized as a COVID-19 Fever Measure (C-19FM). Moreover, the prediction is realized utilizing the temporal recurrent neural network. Additionally, based on the self-organized mapping technique, the presence of C-19VI is determined over a geographical area. Simulation is performed over four challenging datasets.

In particular, we see that most of the cloud-based applications and services often consist of hundreds of micro-services; however, the traditional monolithic pattern is no longer suitable for today’s development life-cycle. This is due to the difficulties of maintenance, scale, load balance, and many other factors associated with it. Consequently, people switch their focus on containerization—a lightweight virtualization technology. The saving grace is that it can use machine resources more efficiently than the virtual machine (VM). In VM, a guest OS is required to simulate on the host machine, whereas containerization enables applications to share a common OS. Furthermore, containerization facilitates users to create, delete, or deploy containers effortlessly. In order to manipulate and manage the multiple containers, the leading Cloud providers introduced the container orchestration platforms, such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Nomad, and many others. In this paper, a rigorous study on Kubernetes from an administrator’s perspective is conducted. In a later stage, serverless computing paradigm was redefined and integrated with Kubernetes to accelerate the development of software applications. Theoretical knowledge and experimental evaluation show that this novel approach can be accommodated by the developers to design software architecture and development more efficiently and effectively by minimizing the cost charged by public cloud providers (such as AWS, GCP, Azure). However, serverless functions are attached with several issues, such as security threats, cold start problem, inadequacy of function debugging, and many other. Consequently, the challenge is to find ways to address these issues. However, there are difficulties and hardships in addressing all the issues altogether. Respectively, in this paper, we simply narrow down our analysis toward the security aspects of serverless. In particular, we quantitatively measure the success probability of attack in serverless (using Attack Tree and Attack–Defense Tree) with the possible attack scenarios and the related countermeasures. Thereafter, we show how the quantification can reflect toward the end-to-end security enhancement. In fine, this study concludes with research challenges such as the burdensome and error-prone steps of setting the platform, and investigating the existing security vulnerabilities of serverless computing, and possible future directions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Attack tree; Container; Container orchestration; FaaS; Kubernetes; Security; Serverless computing","Application programs; Costs; Forestry; Life cycle; Network security; Software design; Virtual machine; Attack tree; Cloud providers; Container orchestration; Empirical research; Empirical studies; Faas; Kubernetes; Research challenges; Security; Serverless computing; Containers",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123475646

The reason for this is that such devices can cause not only informational, but also physical damage. One of the approaches to solving the problem is the static analysis of the machine code of the firmware of such devices. The situation becomes more complicated in the case of a Smart Home, since its devices can have different processor architectures (means instruction sets). In the case of cyberphysical devices of the Smart Home, the destruction of machine code due to physical influences is also possible. Therefore, the first step is to correctly identify the processor architecture. In the interests of this, a machine code model is proposed that has a formal notation and takes into account the possibility of code destruction. The article describes the full cycle of research (including experiment) in order to obtain this model. The model is based on byte-frequency machine code signatures.

As the variety of system and application vulnerabilities has increased dramatically in recent years, cyber attackers have managed to penetrate the networks and infrastructures of larger numbers of companies, thus increasing the latter’s exposure to cyber threats. To mitigate this exposure, it is crucial for CISOs to have sufficient training and skills to help them identify how well security controls are managed and whether these controls offer the company sufficient protection against cyber threats, as expected. However, recent literature shows a lack of clarity regarding the manner in which the CISOs’ role and the companies’ investment in their skills should change in view of these developments. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the CISOs’ level of cyber security-related preparation to mitigate cyber threats (and specifically, the companies’ attitudes toward investing in such preparation) and the recent evolution of cyber threats. Methods: The study data are based on the following public resources: (1) recent scientific literature; (2) cyber threat-related opinion news articles; and (3) OWASP’s reported list of vulnerabilities. Data analysis was performed using various text mining methods and tools. Results: The study’s findings show that although the implementation of cyber defense tools has gained more serious attention in recent years, CISOs still lack sufficient support from management and sufficient knowledge and skills to mitigate current and new cyber threats. Conclusions: The research outcomes may allow practitioners to examine whether the companies’ level of cyber security controls matches the CISOs’ skills, and whether a comprehensive security education program is required. The present article discusses these findings and their implications. © 2022 by the author.

These electronic devices form an in‐vehicle network via the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, the de facto standard for modern vehicles. Alt-hough many ECUs provide convenience to drivers and passengers, they also increase the potential for cyber security threats in motor vehicles. Numerous attacks on vehicles have been reported, and the commonality among these attacks is that they inject malicious messages into the CAN network. To close the security holes of CAN, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) keep the Database CAN (DBC) file describing the content of CAN messages, confidential. This policy is ineffective against cyberattacks but limits in‐depth investigation of CAN messages and hinders the development of in‐vehicle intrusion detection systems (IDS) and CAN fuzz testing. Current research re-verses CAN messages through tokenization, machine learning, and diagnostic information matching to obtain details of CAN messages. However, the results of these algorithms yield only a fraction of the information specified in the DBC file regarding CAN messages, such as field boundaries and message IDs associated with specific functions. In this study, we propose multiple linear regression-based frameworks for bit‐level inversion of CAN messages that can approximate the inversion of DBC files. The framework builds a multiple linear regression model for vehicle behavior and CAN traffic, filters the candidate messages based on the decision coefficients, and finally locates the bits describing the vehicle behavior to obtain the data length and alignment based on the model param-eters. Moreover, this work shows that the system has high reversion accuracy and outperforms ex-isting systems in boundary delineation and filtering relevant messages in actual vehicles. © 2022 by the authors.

Although this modernization brings many far-reaching benefits, the hardware and software newly incorporated into the power systems also incur many vulnerabilities. By taking advantage of these vulnerabilities, adversaries can launch various cyber/physical attacks to tamper with electricity meter readings, i.e., to steal electricity. It is reported that total worldwide annual economic losses caused by electricity theft reached up to almost one hundred billion dollars in recent years. With methods to tamper with meter readings becoming more versatile, secret, and flexible, electricity theft tends to get even more serious in modernized power systems. For preventing adversaries from stealing electricity, researchers have done a lot of works. Although some related surveys on these works exist, they are not updated or just discuss electricity theft in a specific region. This survey aims to gain a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the electricity theft issue. After investigating how adversaries tamper with meter readings, we systematically survey all existing detection methods up to date, which is classified into machine learning- and measurement mismatch-based methods. Adverse effects and political and socioeconomic factors of electricity theft are also provided.

In addition to cloud computing, the ubiquitous presence of modern mobile devices, new measurement tools with embedded connectivity capabilities, and blockchain technologies could greatly improve trust and transparency between the stakeholders interested in the inspection. However, there has been little discussion on integrating these technologies into the mining domain. This paper presents and evaluates an end-to-end system to conduct inspections using mobile devices that directly interact with constrained IoT sensor devices. Furthermore, our proposal provides a method to integrate constrained IoT devices as smart measuring tools that directly interact with a blockchain system, guaranteeing data integrity and increasing the trustworthiness of the data. Finally, we highlight the benefits of our proposed architecture by evaluating a real case study in a mining inspection scenario. © 2022 by the authors.

The jamming attack launches malicious sensor nodes to block legitimate data communications by intentional interference. This can in turn cause monitoring disruptions, data loss and other safety-critical issues. In order to address the malicious attacks, this paper proposes an adaptive anti-jamming solution based on Hyperledger Fabric-based Blockchain, named as ABAS, to ensure the reliability and adaptivity of data communication in case of jamming attacks.

Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) works wirelessly to exchange the traffic status messages to increase the traffic safety and efficiency. During the broadcasting of messages, security and privacy are major concerns. In order to achieve these security and privacy requirements, many authentication schemes have been proposed. However, the performance of these schemes in terms of computational and communication/storage cost is not satisfactory. To address this, we propose an Identity-based Computationally Efficient Privacy-Preserving Authentication (ID-CEPPA) scheme using Identity-based Cryptography (IDC) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in VANETs. The scheme ensures message's source authentication, message integrity, non-repudiation, and anonymity of the vehicle's identity efficiently in V2V communications. In addition, our scheme supports batch-signatures verification method due to which multiple messages are authenticated simultaneously. The security of the ID-CEPPA scheme is proved under Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm problem in the random oracle model. The performance evaluation indicates that ID-CEPPA scheme has less computational and communication/storage cost as compared to the relevant IDC-based signature schemes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Integrity; Internet of Things; Privacy-preserving; Unlikability","Authentication; Computational efficiency; Geometry; Network security; Public key cryptography; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Authentication scheme; Computationally efficient; Identity-based; Integrity; Privacy preserving; Privacy-preserving authentication; Security and privacy; Storage costs; Unlikability; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123235244

This paper presents an efficient multi-hop routing protocol (EMRP) for efficient data dissemination in IoT-enabled WSNs where hierarchy-based energy-efficient routing is involved. It considers a rank-based next-hop selection mechanism. For each device, it considers the residual energy to choose the route for data exchange. We extracted the residual energy at each node and evaluated it based on the connection degree to validate the maximum rank. It allowed us to identify the time slots for measuring the lifetime of the network. We also considered the battery expiry time of the first node to identify the network expiry time. We validated our work through extensive simulations using Network Simulator. We also implemented TCL scripts and C language code to configure low-power sensing devices, cluster heads and sink nodes.

The throughput problem of the blockchain needs to be solved urgently and the security problem of transaction processing that comes with it. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a reputation-driven dynamic node security sharding consensus model (RDSCM) in the blockchain, which consists of two parts: a reputation-driven node to eliminate PBFT (RE-PBFT) and a reputation-driven node cross reconfiguration sharding scheme (NCRS). The RE-PBFT eliminates abnormal nodes in the consensus network and reduces the probability of abnormal nodes becoming master nodes. NCRS improves the blockchain throughput while ensuring sharding reliability. Finally, the experiment proves that RE-PBFT can identify abnormal nodes and remove them in a short time. NCRS can effectively guarantee the reliability of sharding, and the transaction processing efficiency has been greatly improved after sharding. © 2022 by the authors.

Therefore, it is important to ensure data confidentiality in WSN with highly efficient security mechanisms. We proposed a lightweight security transmission method based on information hiding and random data flipping to ensure that the ally fusion center (AFC) can achieve confidential data transmission over insecure open links. First, the sensors’ local measurements are coded into a customized binary string, and then before data transmission, some parts of the string are flipped by the sensors according to the outputs of a pre‐deployed pseudo‐random function. The AFC can recover the flipped binaries using the same function and extract the measurement hidden in the string, while the enemy fusion center (EFC) cannot distinguish flipped and non‐flipped data at all, and they cannot restore the measurement correctly as long as one bit in the string is not correctly recovered. We proved the security and anti‐interference of the scheme through both simulations and physical experiments.

Compared with searching over encrypted certain data, processing queries for encrypted uncertain data is more challenging. In this article, we propose a secure and efficient range query scheme over outsourced encrypted uncertain data, for example, from Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Specifically, we use pivot mapping to map data to a low-dimensional space to facilitate calculation and processing while preserving some of the original relevance among the data. Additionally, we encode data and then map codes into multiple Bloom filters which are organized by a binary tree-based index. Our scheme achieves data privacy, hides the relevance among data, and also supports efficient queries.

According to an intelligent and decentralized method, this technology processes data generated by IoT sensors to seamlessly integrate physical and cyber environments. Internet of Things uses wireless and smart objects. They communicate with each other, monitor the environment, collect information, and respond to user requests. These objects have limited energy resources since they use batteries to supply energy. Also, they cannot replace their batteries. As a result, the network lifetime is limited and short. Thus, reducing energy consumption and accelerating the data transmission process are very important challenges in IoT networks to reduce the response time. In the data transmission process, selecting an appropriate cluster head node is very important because it can reduce the delay when sending data to the fog.

It has its own application domain to upload the clinical data of the patients and treatment procedures to the cloud server. Moreover, the data user may process the queries with suitable sensing parameters to obtain an appropriate medical record. As a result, the development of the Industrial Internet of Things (I-IoT) demands practical insights, trustworthiness, and reliability of intelligent automation to prevent the occurrence of potential risks in the process of production. In the past, multi-keyword searching (MKS) over encrypted cloud data has attracted researchers' attention. As cloud computing is highly practicing, data owners may easily outsource any kind of system data to commercial sites using the Industrial Internet of Things (I-IoT). However, data privacy and protection should be ensured using encryption techniques before any sensitive data is outsourced over insecure public networks. Providing cloud data encryption and secure keyword searching still exist as challenging issues. In I-IoT, cloud computing deals with a large amount of data users and documents, thus a technique like MKS is highly necessitated to process the search request and secure query processing. Thus, this paper presents a privacy-preservation phrase with multi-keyword ranked searching (PPP-MKRS) that introduces optimized filtering, binary tree index structure, and conjunctive keyword search to achieve secure searching efficiency. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed PPP-MKRS scheme consumes less computation, storage, and verification time in comparison with other searching encryption techniques. © 2021","Cloud computing; Data privacy; Industrial internet of things; Multi-keyword searching; Protection; Secure searching efficiency","Binary trees; Cloud computing; Cryptography; Digital storage; Efficiency; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Network security; Patient treatment; Query processing; Search engines; Trees (mathematics); Cloud data; Cloud-computing; Data users; Keyword searching; Multi keywords; Multi-keyword searching; Privacy preservation; Protection; Searching efficiency; Secure searching efficiency; Data privacy",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122545710

In addition, if any one of the hosts has less capacity than its workload, then that particular host is predicted by the HGW–ALM model and the specified host is maintained by the LSR approach.

AI technologies have been widely applied in crowdsourcing applications for IoT security. However, there are still several issues to be stressed. There exist malicious participants aiming at gaining unjust payment. A trust evaluation mechanism can effectively filter the attackers. Nevertheless, the existing trust evaluation mechanisms cannot preclude co-cheating and overlook the conflicts with the privacy exposure of participants. A novel Privacy-protected Intelligent Crowdsourcing scheme based on Reinforcement Learning (PICRL) is proposed. PICRL optimizes the utility of the system considering the data amount, data quality, and costs at the same time. The main innovations of the PICRL are as follows. First, the quality is guaranteed by an effective trust evaluation mechanism. The proposed trust evaluation consists of three parts: privacy trust, crowd trust, and hybrid active trust. Second, the trust evaluation can effectively prevent co-cheating and provide personal privacy exposure choice for the participants. Third, PICRL maximizes the utility based on evaluated trust utilizing the reinforcement method Q-learning without knowing the specific sensing model, which aims at maximizing the cumulated reward by the selection of state–action pair.

Numerous state of art works has been developed to achieve security in fiber optic communication. Among the various methods, compression then encryption is an effective way to effectively and securely transmit the data. With this motivation, this paper presents a new Low Complexity Compression Then Encryption using Optimal Homomorphic Encryption (LCCE-OHE) technique for secured fiber optic communication. The proposed LCCE-OHE technique operates on two major phases namely compression and encryption. At the first stage, low complexity compression using Neighboring Indexing Sequence (NIS) with Deflate algorithm, named Normalized Information Distance (NID) is used. Besides, in the second stage, Quasi Oppositional Sail Fish Optimizer with Homomorphic Encryption (QOSFO-HE) technique is employed. The QOSFO algorithm is derived by incorporating the quasi oppositional learning (QOBL) concept to the SFO algorithm and is applied to optimally select the encryption keys.

The volume of digital data in general and security event data in specific is increasing exponentially. The velocity with which security event data is generated and fed into a BDCA system is unpredictable. Therefore, a BDCA system should be highly scalable to deal with the unpredictable increase/decrease in the velocity of security event data. However, there has been little effort to investigate the scalability of BDCA systems to identify and exploit the sources of scalability improvement. In this paper, we first investigate the scalability of a Spark-based BDCA system with default Spark settings. We then identify Spark configuration parameters (e.g., execution memory) that can significantly impact the scalability of a BDCA system. Based on the identified parameters, we finally propose a parameter-driven adaptation approach, SCALER, for optimizing a system's scalability. We have conducted a set of experiments by implementing a Spark-based BDCA system on a large-scale OpenStack cluster. We ran our experiments with four security datasets. We have found that (i) a BDCA system with default settings of Spark configuration parameters deviates from ideal scalability by 59.5% (ii) 9 out of 11 studied Spark configuration parameters significantly impact scalability and (iii) SCALER improves the BDCA system's scalability by 20.8% compared to the scalability with default Spark parameter setting.

Understanding the threat landscape and the adversaries’ attack tactics to perform it represent key factors for enabling an efficient defense against threats over the time. Of particular importance is the acquisition of timely and accurate information from threats intelligence sources available on the web which can provide additional intelligence on emerging threats even before they can be observed as actual attacks. Currently, specific indicators of compromise (e.g. IP addresses, domains, hashsums of malicious files) are shared in a semi-automated and structured way via so-called threat feeds. Unfortunately, current systems have to deal with the trade-off between the timeliness of such an alert (i.e. warning at the first mention of a threat) and the need to wait for verification by other sources (i.e. warning after multiple sources have verified the threat). In addition, due to the increasing number of open sources, it is challenging to find the right balance between feasibility and costs in order to identify a relatively small subset of valuable sources. In this paper, a method to automate the assessment of cyber threat intelligence sources and predict a relevance score for each source is proposed. Specifically, a model based on meta-data and word embedding is defined and experimented by training regression models to predict the relevance score of sources on Twitter. The results evaluation show that the assigned score allows to reduce the waiting time for intelligence verification, on the basis of its relevance, thus improving the time advantage of early threat detection. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cybersecurity; Feature engineering; Machine learning; Open source cyber threat intelligence; Twitter","Cybersecurity; Economic and social effects; Malware; Regression analysis; Social networking (online); Cyber security; Cyber threats; Defensive measures; Feature engineerings; Intelligence sources; Key factors; Large scale data; Open source cybe threat intelligence; Open-source; Relevance score; Machine learning",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121235247

Technologies such as network penetration, public opinion guidance and attacks, cognitive intervention and control will become the main development directions. Controlling public opinion and controlling audiences will become the cyberspace cognitive domain. In recent years, emerging network media such as social networks and mobile communication networks have played an important organizational and planning role in a series of significant events, which are likely to cause severe threats to national security and even the international community's stability. We analyzed and clarified social network actors, environment, scene, manipulation and ethical framework. We conclude that social public opinion weapons are mainly divided into six categories: Bot, Botnet, Troll, Manipulate real people and events, Cyborg, and Hacked or stolen. Since social network warfare is a brand new war situation in the context of great powers, in social media, the confrontation of camps can be observed. States use social media platforms to penetrate and media war, and its Internet space monitor and build defenses. A digital wall has been placed horizontally on the boundary of the virtual space. In recent years, as the trend towards weaponization of social media has become increasingly apparent, military powers such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia have taken the initiative to take the lead in the field of social media. All countries continue to strengthen the research on fundamental cognitive theories. Many basic research projects that integrate information, biology, network, and cognition have been launched one after another. The combat practice shows that the effectiveness of social media even exceeds some traditional combat methods. With the prominent role of social media in modern warfare, its combat use has become increasingly widespread and has gradually become a force multiplier in modern warfare. At present, the deployment of weapons directed by social network users in significant countries is mainly focused on incident and public opinion reconnaissance, sentiment analysis, and active intervention. Our research enumerates the social weapon component model and software architecture. In short, all countries are using social media to spread political propaganda and influence the digital information ecosystem. This article enhances our understanding and development trend of public opinion wars in the social network, and proposes an architecture system for the social weapon arsenal. The technical means, scale, scope, and precision of social media weapons have been continuously improved. It is gaining momentum to reshape the cyberspace security pattern of various countries fundamentally. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cyberspace weapons; Public opinion; Social network; Warfare and manipulation","National security; Network architecture; Network security; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Space platforms; Cyberspace weapon; Cyberspaces; Modern warfare; Network behaviors; Network domains; Physical network; Public opinions; Social media; Social network; Warfare and manipulation; Social aspects",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121002087

At the same time, these managers have to deal with many internal processes and criteria, in addition to requirements from external parties, such as regulators that pose an additional challenge to handling threats and incidents. Little research has been carried out to understand to what extent decision support can aid these professionals in managing threats and incidents. The purpose of this research was to develop decision support for cybersecurity threat and incident managers in the financial sector. To this end, we carried out a cognitive task analysis and the first two phases of a cognitive work analysis, based on two rounds of in-depth interviews with ten professionals from three financial institutions. Our results show that decision support should address the problem of balancing the bigger picture with details. That is, being able to simultaneously keep the broader operational context in mind as well as adequately investigating, containing and remediating a cyberattack. In close consultation with the three financial institutions involved, we developed a critical-thinking memory aid that follows typical incident response process steps, but adds big picture elements and critical thinking steps. This should make cybersecurity threat and incident managers more aware of the broader operational implications of threats and incidents while keeping a critical mindset. Although a summative evaluation was beyond the scope of the present research, we conducted iterative formative evaluations of the memory aid that show its potential. © 2021","Cognitive task analysis; Cognitive work analysis; Cybersecurity; Decision support; Incident response; Information security risk management","Decision making; Decision support systems; Finance; Job analysis; Managers; Risk assessment; Risk management; Cognitive task analysis; Cognitive work analysis; Critical thinking; Cyber security; Decision supports; Financial institution; Financial sectors; Incident response; Information security risk managements; Memory aids; Cybersecurity",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120951141

This paper offers a fast and secure mechanism for revocation checking, processing and PKI key pair updating called the Enhanced Secure Authentication and Revocation (ESAR) scheme for VANETs. The ESAR Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) authentication method applies Keyed-Hash-based Message Authentication Code (H-MAC) cryptogram validation for On-Board-Unit (OBU) revocation checks instead of the CRL search. We examined the ESAR together with a similar VANET scheme and achieved better results. We selected the Expedite Message Authentication Protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (EMAP), which, upon a review of the literature, was seen to offer fewer countermeasures to provide resistance to most attacks. In addition, we completed the missing parts of the EMAP scheme with performance improvements and we compared it with other schemes in terms of security. Our ESAR scheme includes the following improvements. (1) The unauthorized update protection of sensitive assets is handled by revocation key sender verification and revocation version validation. (2) Privacy concerns are addressed by the use of keyed trimmed H-MAC-based pseudo ID creation. (3) Reliable data transmission issues are resolved by including missing message identification tags. (4) Performance concerns are addressed by eliminating and combining network requests to offer fast security key revocation. We targeted system performance and durability and also attack resistance using anomaly detection improvements. We ran three simulations: the standard (using CRL only), the proposed (ESAR), and the existing (EMAP) methods. According to the findings of our simulation analysis, our proposed system was more efficient in terms of performance and network congestion than the other examined methods. © 2021","Authentication Scheme; CRL; IoV; PKI; Revocation; VANET Security","Anomaly detection; Authentication; Network security; Vehicles; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Authentication scheme; Certificate revocation list; IoV; Networks security; Public key infrastructure; Revocation; Revocation scheme; Secure authentications; Vehicle ad hoc network security; Vehicle ad-hoc networks; Public key cryptography",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120869674

By providing the attackers with well-designed obfuscated path measurement metrics, AntiTomo can lead the attackers to form a fake network topology view, which hides the key elements (i.e., the key links and the key nodes) of the physical network. To generate an obfuscated network topology with high deceptive features efficiently, AntiTomo uses the multi-objective optimization model to construct the obfuscated topology with security and low-cost features.

Moreover, in the multi-level structure of the financial supply chain of the Internet of Things enterprise, there are information barriers and information islands. Besides, data is often not transmitted smoothly, and the intermediate offline process is complicated. What is worse, the efficiency is low, and the verification cost is high. Therefore, based on supply chain finance, an evolutionary risk model is constructed in this paper. Firstly, the income matrix of the regulatory risk model is established, and the convolutional neural network used will pool the training data to the maximum and set the local corresponding normalization layer. With the help of the evolutionary risk theory, the dynamic equation of the financial supply chain is obtained, forming the dynamic path and abnormal model of strategy selection. Then, a compact pattern tree is added to the knowledge granularity method to mine data anomalies. Finally, an experimental platform is built to verify the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper, and experiments are performed on the accuracy of model evolution conditions, abnormal data identification, and abnormal numerical examples. The experimental results prove that the algorithm in this paper is consistent with the set parameters, and the effect is significantly higher than other comparison methods. The experimental mining time and the comparison method are shortened by 6∼13S.

Particularly, due to the characteristics of fifth-Generation (5G) networks including low network latency and high data rate, vehicles can enjoy remote services in a real-time, high-quality and low-cost way. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) have confirmed that remote diagnosis should be one of the development cores of Vehicle to everything (V2X). However, as vehicle safety is directly attached to the passengers’ safety, it is also a key point to ensure the security of remote diagnosis and maintenance services. In this paper, based on extended Chebyshev chaotic maps, we propose a robust authentication scheme for remote diagnosis and maintenance in 5G V2N. In the proposed scheme, to achieve strong security, anybody, such as the vehicle owner or the Vehicle Service Center (VSC) employee, must enter the valid biometrics and password before enjoying or providing remote diagnosis and maintenance services, and the vehicle and the VSC should authenticate each other to ensure that they are legitimate.

This residual risk forms part of the ongoing operational environment, and must be understood and planned for if resilience is to be achieved. However, there is a lack of rigorous frameworks to help organisations reason about how their use of risk controls can change the nature of the potential losses they face, given an often changing threat landscape. To address this gap, we present a system that calculates Cyber-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of an organisation. CVaR is a probabilistic density function for losses from cyber-incidents, for any given threats of interest and risk control practice. It can take account of varying effectiveness of controls, the consequences for risk propagation through infrastructures, and the cyber-harms that result. We demonstrate the utility of the system in a real case study by calculating the CVaR of an organisation that experienced a significant cyber-incident. We show that the system is able to produce predictions representative of the actual financial loss. The presented system can be used by insurers offering cyber products to better inform the calculation of insurance premiums, and by organisations to reason about the effects of using particular risk control setups on reducing their exposure to cyber-risk. © 2021 The Authors","Cyber-harm; Cyber-value-at-risk; Cybersecurity; Enterprise security; Monte Carlo simulations; Online harm; Risk controls","Cybersecurity; Insurance; Intelligent systems; Losses; Monte Carlo methods; Network security; Cybe-harm; Cybe-value-at-risk; Cyber security; Enterprise security; Exposed to; Monte Carlo's simulation; Online harm; Risks controls; Security controls; Value at Risk; Value engineering",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120622981

To this end, a mode-detector is first employed to estimate the system mode that is unavailable under DoS attacks. And then, a synchronous/asynchronous switching estimator is constructed to observe the unmeasurable system state, meanwhile, estimate the attacked system output. Based on the above estimator, a synchronous/asynchronous switching sliding mode controller is designed, the corresponding sufficient conditions are derived by introducing a novel Lyapunov function.

Hence, object identification is a significant issue as some bogus objects may take part for malicious access. Considering this situation, RFID can be used for unique identification and validation of IoT objects. However, it recognizes many objects at the same time and faces limitations like non-repudiations, injection of fake objects, and unclonability issues. Alternatively, security limitations between tags and readers are analyzed and found that whole communication depends on limited computational resource and simple operations such as hash function, XOR operation, and so forth. Moreover, the communication channel between reader and backend server is secure due to symmetric or asymmetric key encryption algorithms. As the information is exchanged by the tags with readers, a secure path must be maintained among them for safe communication with cloud server. For the development of secure path and verification of objects, ECC-based Cramer-Shoup encryption, cryptographic authentication protocol (CAP), and device fingerprinting can be used. To overcome the existing limitations, we are motivated to design an ECC-based secure object tracking and key exchange protocol that allows the owner device to be offline during communication. This suggested scheme is referred as ESOTP. Several recognized cryptographic attacks are evaluated, the security strength is validated and found that ESOTP is resilient against those attacks. Finally, a comparative study is performed regarding the security features and performance efficiency of ESOTP with other existing schemes and enhanced results are found. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"Authentication; Hash functions; Internet of things; Public key cryptography; Tracking (position); Cryptographic authentication protocol; Cryptographic authentication protocols; Elliptic curve cryptography; Internet of thing; Object Tracking; Physically unclonable function; Physically unclonable functions; Radio frequency identification; Radio-frequency-identification; Tracking protocols; Radio frequency identification (RFID)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120315150

Many emerging technologies have been proposed to provide users with comfortable and convenient driving experience. However, even though these technologies significantly improve the quality of service, some of the communication interfaces they used are vulnerable and easily attacked. Note that although many malicious attacks can be carried out in various ways, their final step must be in the in-vehicle network, i.e., the controller area network (CAN) bus. In order to protect the security of the CAN bus, it is of great importance to design an intrusion detection system (IDS), which can monitor the message transmission in real time. In this article, we design a novel external IDS based on vehicle voltage signals, named VehicleEIDS. It does not occupy the bandwidth or computing resources of the CAN bus and maintains the original CAN bus protocol as well. The system can be directly installed in the automobile gateway to monitor the external intrusion, and can be connected to the CAN bus as an independent external device to protect the automobile security. In addition, VehicleEIDS is robust against the factors of vehicle status, the number of attacking electronic control units (ECUs), and the sending frequency of attack data. It is only related to the voltage signals of external intrusion device.

Nonetheless, the effectiveness of many of the current training offerings is put into question by reports of increasing successful cyber-attacks. While a number of models for developing Cybersecurity (CS) training frameworks for industrial personnel or general audience have been proposed, these models often lack consideration for humans aspects of learning (cognitive abilities, learning styles, meta-cognition among others) during development. Additionally, the success of a CS training program highly depends on its ability to engage participants. To develop a CS training framework that is able to motivate participants, we must consider individual-specific factors that can affect the result of training, besides establishing optimal training delivery methods and assessment. For this, in this work we propose a CS training framework based on a revised version of the ADDIE model and more recent research personalised learning theory. The Delphi method was used to both develop and validate our decisions during the development of the training framework model. The results of the decision of the Delphi method have later been compared to recommendations in the literature to create the finalised framework. This work presents two major distinctions from other CS training frameworks models described in the literature. First, the developed model is strongly based in learning theory foundations and takes into consideration differences in learning styles, cognitive abilities and metacognition of individuals, to offer tailored solutions optimized for each group of employees and single individual. Second, the use of the Delphi method and the involvement of experts stakeholders from various sides of academia and industry gave a wide insight into current needs and recommendations for CS training, as well as formal validation for the final development. © 2021 The Authors","Cyber-security; Delphi method; Learning theory; Personalizedp learning; Training framework","Decision making; Learning systems; Network security; Personnel training; 'current; Cognitive ability; Cyber security; Delphi method; Framework models; Large companies; Learning Theory; Learningstyles; Personalizedp learning; Training framework; Cybersecurity",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119906834

In a networked control system, DoS attacks have serious impacts on the security of communication, possibly causing degraded stability performance of the system. To remove threats from DoS attacks, an adaptive event-triggered communication mechanism is proposed, which also provides benefits in reducing the consumption of communication resources and relieving the pressure on network bandwidth. Since the system state information is usually not fully known, an observer-based controller is developed to stabilize the system and maintain a desired performance index despite the occurrence of stochastic attacks. Furthermore, a joint design method is proposed to obtain the controller gain, observer gain and event-triggered weight matrix. Finally, practical examples based on a four-tank system, an Internet-based three-tank system and an Internet-based test rig system are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques to respond and eliminate the impact of DoS attacks. 1549-8328 © 2021 IEEE.","Denial-of-service attack; Networked control systems; Observers; Sensor systems; Sensors; Stochastic processes; Symmetric matrices","Adaptive control systems; Controllers; Denial-of-service attack; Network security; Networked control systems; Random processes; Tanks (containers); Adaptive event-triggered mechanism; Denialof- service attacks; Event-triggered; Observer; Observer-based controllers; Resilient observer-based controller; Sensor systems; Stochastic denial-of-service attack.; Stochastics; Symmetric matrices; Stochastic systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119598352

This paper presents a countermeasure based on single-dimensional encryption to defend against stealthy attacks. Instead of encrypting one entry of the original measurements, a linear or nonlinear transformation of them is encrypted in order to enhance the security level of the system. It is proved that for most systems, single-dimensional encryption can completely resist innovation-based stealthy attacks. For other special cases, the worst-case constrained attack that yields the greatest estimation error is analyzed. Accordingly, a suboptimal encryption strategy can reduce the influence of attacks effectively. In addition, a new type of innovation-based stealthy attack is proposed. This attack model does not require the calculation of the nominal innovation and can usually lead to greater estimation errors. The worst-case attack for this model is derived analytically. The effectiveness of single-dimensional encryption against the proposed attack is also analyzed.

RPL is one such popular routing protocol for IoT devices and systems. However, security in RPL is an afterthought, and it does not meet the demands of today's complex cyberthreat landscape. Focusing on sybil attack detection in RPL-based IoT, we first propose a lightweight Bloom filter and physical unclonable function (PUF) based sybil attack detection mechanism (hereafter referred to as liteSAD). Our approach is designed to minimize memory cost as well as detection latency, without affecting the detection accuracy. Specifically, in liteSAD, Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root generates a Bloom filter array through hashing each legitimate node's identifier and PUF response, and distributes it through a new packet named BF-DAO. Upon receiving the BF-DAO packet, each legitimate node retrieves the Bloom filter array, updates its local copy, and employs it to detect sybil attack. We also propose a probabilistic DIO reply mechanism (i.e., proDIO) to reduce the number of broadcasted DIO packets in response to attack DIS packets. We investigate the setting of Bloom filter parameters that minimize the probability of false positive and time complexity while meeting the requirement of memory constraints in IoT devices. We also evaluate the performance of our mechanism liteSAD+proDIO through extensive simulation experiments, where the results demonstrate that liteSAD+proDIO can provide better performance in terms of detection rate, detection latency, miss detection rate, DIO Trickle timer, number of broadcasted DIO packets, and energy consumption. In summary, our major contributions are twofold: (i) the comprehensive analysis of RPL routing protocol, Trickle algorithm, and the impact of sybil attack; and (ii) the proposal of lightweight Bloom filter and PUF based sybil attack detection mechanism. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bloom filter; IoT; Lightweight detection; Physical unclonable function; Sybil attack","Computer crime; Cryptography; Directed graphs; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Attack detection; Bloom filters; Detection latency; Detection mechanism; Detection rates; Filter arrays; Lightweight detection; Performance; Routing-protocol; Sybil attack; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119446441

The IaaS approach ensures significant flexibility and manageability, since the networking resources and topologies are entirely under users' control.

Deep and genuine integration between the two ecosystems, Cloud and IoT, may only be attainable at the IaaS level.

We consider attacks whose goals are to corrupt the state estimator and/or the operation of the power grid. By considering AC-based models of the state estimator and the operation of the power system, the proposed model allows quantifying the reliability consequences (i.e., alteration in the active and reactive power), and the economic consequences (e.g., distorting locational marginal prices) of such attacks. We consider a resource-constrained omniscient attacker intending to alter the operation of the power system. We impose a stealthy condition on the attacker so that its malicious action is invisible to the bad-data-detection algorithm. The upper-level problem of the proposed bilevel model represents the attacker's action and pursues disrupting the system operation and it is constrained by two lower-level problems.

The existing IoT suffers from the limitations of resource allocation ranging between complicated service provisioning environments and networking service quality mismatching. IoT environment needs to handle the resource allocation issue for attaining satisfactory degree of quality of experience (QoE) that maps multiple resources to gateways. This problem of mapping multiple resources to gateways belongs to the class of NP-complete problem and can be ideally solved through intelligent metaheuristic algorithms. In this paper, galactic swarm-improved whale optimization algorithm-based resource management (GSIWOA-RM) scheme is proposed for efficient mapping of multiple resources to gateways in IoT.

Existing approaches rely on the domain knowledge of security experts to identify the behavioural patterns, categorise and classify cyber attacks.

We applied three clustering algorithms, i.e., K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models and Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, on our data set of AE features. We discussed the clustering arrangements for understanding the impact of changes in commands on behavioural patterns of attacks and how attacks are grouped in the same or different clusters.

Digital systems offer maintenance and usability advantages, but are prone to cyberattacks. The conventional belief that digital systems are essentially free from cyberattacks owing to the presence of air gaps has been negated by several attacks on actual NPPs. Theoretically, a system can be secured by using all possible security measures. However, in reality, the resources available for cybersecurity are limited. Therefore, the efficient distribution of resources is a critical issue. The conventional methods were mainly focused on impairment failure. In this study, we propose a system that suggests the most attractive attack path that can consider both type 1 (impairment failure) and type 2 (Byzantine failure) security failure. The proposed algorithm consists of two parts: a graph map that evaluates the attractiveness of an attack path, and a path-finding part that searches for the shortest path in the graph map. To quantify the attractiveness of the attack path, we propose a resistance concept. In addition, we quantify the importance of components in the system using a page-rank algorithm. We adopt Dijkstra's algorithm to automatically determine the most attractive path. With the proposed methodology, it is expected that an attractive attack path that considers both type 1 and type 2 security failure can be found, and a corresponding efficient cybersecurity strategy can be established. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cybersecurity; Dijkstra's algorithm; Instrumentation and control system; Page-rank algorithm; Resistance","Control systems; Graph theory; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Outages; Attack path; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Digital system; Dijkstra's algorithms; Industrial control systems; Instrumentation and control system; PageRank algorithm; Resistance; Security failure; Cyber attacks; Cybersecurity",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116879448

However, SCADA systems are continuously exposed to various heterogeneous cyberattacks, making the detection task using the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) very challenging. Furthermore, conventional security solutions, such as firewalls, and antivirus software, are not appropriate for fully protecting SCADA systems because they have distinct specifications. Thus, accurately detecting cyber-attacks in critical SCADA systems is undoubtedly indispensable to enhance their resilience, ensure safe operations, and avoid costly maintenance. The overarching goal of this paper is to detect malicious intrusions that already detoured traditional IDS and firewalls. In this paper, a stacked deep learning method is introduced to identify malicious attacks targeting SCADA systems. Specifically, we investigate the feasibility of a deep learning approach for intrusion detection in SCADA systems. Real data sets from two laboratory-scale SCADA systems, a two-line three-bus power transmission system and a gas pipeline are used to evaluate the proposed method’s performance.

Due to the distributed nature of ICS devices, a detection-in-depth strategy is required to simultaneously monitor the behaviour of multiple sources of ICS data. While a detection-in-depth method leads to detecting attacks, like flooding attacks in earlier phases before the attacker can reach the end target, most research papers have focused on anomaly detection based on a single source of ICS data. Here, we present a detection-in-depth method for an ICS network. The new method is called automated flooding attack detection (AFAD) which consists of three stages: data acquisition, pre-processing, and a flooding anomaly detector. Data acquisition includes data collection from different sources like programmable logic controller (PLC) logs and network traffic. We then generate NetFlow data to provide light-weight anomaly detection in ICS networks. NetFlow-based analysis has been used as a scalable method for anomaly detection in high-speed networks. It only analyses packet headers, and it is an efficient method for detecting flooding attacks like denial of service attacks, and its performance is not affected by encrypted data. However, it has not been sufficiently studied in industrial control systems. Besides NetFlow data, ICS device logs are a rich source of information that can be used to detect abnormal behaviour. Both NetFlow traffic and log data are processed in our pre-processing stage. The third stage of AFAD is anomaly detection which consists of two parallel machine learning analysis methods, which respectively analyse the behaviours of device logs and NetFlow records. Due to the lack of enough labelled training datasets in most environments, an unsupervised predictor and an unsupervised clustering method are respectively used in the anomaly detection stage. We validated our approach using traffic captured in a factory automation dataset, Modbus dataset, and SWAT dataset. These datasets contain physical and network level normal and abnormal data. The performance of AFAD was compared with single-layer anomaly detection and with other studies. Results showed the high precision of AFAD in detecting flooding attacks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Anomaly detection; Histogram clustering; Industrial control systems; Log analysis; NetFlow-based analysis; Prediction","Anomaly detection; Denial-of-service attack; HIgh speed networks; Legacy systems; Network security; SCADA systems; Well logging; Anomaly detection; Attack detection; Depth method; Flooding attacks; Histogram clustering; Industrial control systems; Log analysis; Netflow-based analyse; NetFlows; Systems networks; Scalability",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116147467

In this paper, we propose a unified and standard testbed for cyber defense strategy simulation and bench-marking, which would allow the users to investigate current approaches and compare them with others, while ultimately aiding in the selection of the best approach for a given network security situation. We have compared the network performance in difference scenarios namely, normal, under attack and under attack in presence of NICS-based adaptive defense mechanism and achieved stable experimental results. The experimental results clearly show that the proposed testbed is able to simulate the network conditions effectively with minimum efforts in network configuration. The simulation results of defense mechanisms verified on the proposed testbed got the improvement on almost 80 percent while increasing the turnaround time to 1–2 percent. The applicability of proposed testbed in modern technologies like Fog Computing and Edge Computing is also discussed in this paper. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive cyber defense; Computer Network Operations; Cyber range; Nature-Inspired Cyber Security; Network simulation; Performance tuning","Biomimetics; Home networks; Network architecture; Network security; Personal communication systems; Testbeds; Adaptive cybe defense; Computer network operations; Cybe range; Cyber security; Cyber-defense; Defence mechanisms; Defense strategy; Nature-inspired cybe security; Network simulation; Performance tuning; Cybersecurity",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116004679

Therefore, it is crucial to employ intrusion detection techniques to mitigate attacks that exploit IoT security vulnerabilities. However, due to the limited capabilities of IoT devices and the specific protocols used, conventional intrusion detection mechanisms may not work well for IoT environments. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection model that uses machine learning to effectively detect cyber-attacks and anomalies in resource-constraint IoT networks. Through a set of optimizations including removal of multicollinearity, sampling, and dimensionality reduction, our model can identify the most important features to detect intrusions using much fewer training data and less training time. Extensive experiments were performed on the CICIDS2017 and NSL-KDD datasets respectively to evaluate the proposed approach. The experimental results on two popular datasets show that our model has a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. It outperforms existing models in multiple performance metrics and is consistent in classifying major cyber-attacks, respectively. Most importantly, unlike traditional resource-intensive intrusion detection systems, the proposed model is lightweight and can be deployed on IoT nodes with limited power and storage capabilities. © 2021","Intrusion detection; IoT network; Machine learning; Security","Computer crime; Crime; Digital storage; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network security; Regression analysis; Detection mechanism; Internet of thing network; Intrusion detection models; Intrusion-Detection; Optimisations; Resource Constraint; Security; Security breaches; Security vulnerabilities; Specific protocol; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115908379

The exponential growth of cars number badly impacts the transportation system (TS) on which most cities are living on. Traffic control is one of the most critical issues in TS, which depends on a set of cooperative traffic lights. Smart Traffic lights, which can receive and analyze traffic data, can solve traffic problems by efficiently predict the accurate waiting time for each traffic lane at the intersections. This can improve the traffic flow and accordingly promotes the transportation system performance. This paper introduces a Fog-Based Traffic Light Management Strategy (TLMS) based on Fuzzy Inference Engine. TLMS can accurately calculate the optimal waiting time for each traffic lane at the intersections to decrease the average waiting time for the stopped vehicles. TLMS applies Vehicle to infrastructure protocol (V2I) that allows vehicles to interact directly with the infrastructure of the road such as GPS sensors and the traffic light signals. At each traffic intersection, the number of waiting vehicles, their locations relative to TLMS, and their sizes are detected and sent to TLMS in real time. Then, based on fuzzy inference, TLMS can calculate the optimal waiting time for each lane, which optimizes the traffic flow at the intersection by minimizing the waiting time for the vehicles. The performance of the proposed TLMS has been compared and tested against recently proposed techniques via simulation. The results of the experiment showed that TLMS outperforms recent technologies as it minimizes the average waiting time of vehicles around the intersections and accordingly maximizes the performance of the traffic system. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Fog computing; Fuzzy; GPS; IoT; Smart city; Traffic light; Traffic management","Engines; Fog; Fog computing; Fuzzy inference; Smart city; Street traffic control; Traffic signals; Fuzzy; Fuzzy inference engines; Management strategies; Traffic flow; Traffic lanes; Traffic light; Traffic light managements; Traffic management; Transportation system; Waiting time; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115651192

And despite the rising admiration of machine learning and deep learning methods in the cyber-security domain (e.g., a threat detection system), most of these methods are acknowledged as a black-box model. The explainable AI (XAI) has become progressively vital to understand the employed learning models to improve trust level and empower security experts to interpret the prediction decisions. The authors propose a highly efficient model named XSRU-IoMT, for effective and timely detection of sophisticated attack vectors in IoMT networks. The proposed model is developed using novel bidirectional simple recurrent units (SRU) using the phenomenon of skip connections to eradicate the vanishing gradient problem and achieve a fast training process in recurrent networks.

With the remarkably increasing usage of smart grid systems over conventional utility grid networks, it becomes imperative to ensure that such a system is secured from potential threats. Energy theft by meter tampering and false data injection (FDI) attacks are the most common forms of attacks that attempt to compromise the security of a smart grid system. In this paper, we introduce a new machine learning-based multi-model prediction system known as intelligent energy cyber physical systems (iECPS) for smart energy theft detection and verification. Furthermore, the system has more robustness since a verification from the users themselves (through e-mail) is considered as final validation to decide further course of action. In addition, to successfully detect and prevent FDI attack during transmission of data from sub-meters or meters to smart grids, a watermarking and de-watermarking system is also proposed. It involves encryption and decryption of meter data by means of a PN-sequence available at both ends. The proposed scheme detects electricity theft performed by tapping on the user’s smart meter with high accuracy. Also, the watermarking scheme discerns FDI attacks while maintaining data consistency, with a significant similarity factor and low channel SNR.

An adaptive state observer with a low computational burden is designed to estimate the voltage and current of a dc-dc converter. The proposed method considers the effects of cyber-attacks by injecting false data (FD) at targeted nodes in an attempt to affect the voltage regulation and current sharing by modifying the onboard voltage and current sensors. In the presented strategy, first, a DCMG is operated and controlled without any false data injecting attacks with different load conditions. Next, the DCMG is exposed to various cyber-attacks, and the output voltages and currents of dc-dc converters are estimated. Based on the error between the estimated and actual sensed signals, the cyber-attack is detected and corrected with the proposed framework. The proposed scheme is simple in design, efficient in operation, and easily implemented in a distributed control system.

However, existing methods failed due to security attacks during the tenure of access transactions and aggregated services. Recently, blockchain technology enables service centers depends on various platforms to share transaction records. But, it is difficult to store the transaction record because of its size. To address these issues, we proposed a SECure LearningChain (SEC-LearningChain) design based on the integration of blockchain technology, machine learning (ML), and cloud computing primitives are applied together for a secure data transaction in a Peer to Peer network as well as efficient data sharing service. This approach consists of four design models: First, an attack detection model detects the attack using threshold-based anomalous traffic detector in the transaction network. Second, a mold blockchain transaction network model is designed based on the cryptographic hash and encryption to deal with threats and validate the identity verification process for a secure transaction. Next, the large-scale transaction record is optimized and trains the ML model for the output prediction. Finally, the cloud assessment model manages the stored transaction records and easily share the accessed services across different cloud platforms for each service center.

However, these credentials are significantly larger than the MTU and are, therefore, sent in a large number of fragments. As IoT devices are resource constrained and battery powered, there are considerable computations and communication overheads for fragment processing both on the sender and receiver devices, which limit their ability to serve real-time requests. Moreover, the fragment processing operations increase energy consumption by CPUs and radio transceivers, which results in shorter battery life. In this article, we propose CATComp—a compression-aware authorization protocol for constrained application protocol (CoAP) and datagram transport layer security (DTLS) that enables IoT devices to exchange small-sized certificates and capability tokens over the IEEE 802.15.4 media. CATComp introduces additional messages in the CoAP and DTLS handshakes that allow communicating devices to negotiate a compression method, which devices use to reduce the credentials' sizes before sending them over an IEEE 802.15.4 link. The decrease in the size of the security materials minimizes the total number of packet fragments, communication overheads for fragment delivery, fragment processing delays, and energy consumption. As such, devices can respond to requests faster and have longer battery life. We implement a prototype of CATComp on Contiki-enabled RE-Mote IoT devices and provide a performance analysis of CATComp. The experimental results show that communication latency and energy consumption are reduced when CATComp is integrated with CoAP and DTLS. © 2021 IEEE.","Authentication; Authorization; Internet of Things; Payloads; Protocols; Receivers; Security","Electric batteries; Energy utilization; IEEE Standards; Physical layer; Program processors; Radio transceivers; Radio transmission; Communication latency; Communication overheads; Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP); Internet of thing (IOT); Maximum transmission units; Performance analysis; Processing operations; Transport layer security; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113238207

However, the sensors involved in such systems are rarely adopted in residential houses due to their relatively high costs and users' privacy concerns. Low-cost and nonintrusive IoT sensors have been proposed for residential houses for use with machine-learning algorithms. Furthermore, such sensors may be triggered very infrequently due to their nonintrusive nature, and it can take several days/weeks to collect sufficient training data. There is a research gap in accurately detecting occupancy information in residential houses with limited training data. This article proposes a trust-based occupancy detection scheme, which achieves high detection accuracy based on limited training data collected by nonintrusive, low-cost sensors. First, rather than directly taking raw sensor data as inputs, the semantic meanings (i.e., human activity sequences) are extracted from the data based on the order of triggered sensors. Second, the extracted human activity sequences are fed into the proposed trust-based sequence matching scheme for further occupancy detection. Comprehensive experimental results show that, when compared to existing occupancy detection algorithms, the proposed scheme can reliably achieve higher accuracy, especially when only limited training data is available. © 2021 IEEE.","Buildings; Machine learning algorithms; Sensor systems; Sensors; Temperature measurement; Temperature sensors; Training data","Costs; Energy efficiency; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Houses; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Office buildings; Privacy by design; Semantics; Building energy consumption; Commercial building; Detection accuracy; Internet of Things (IOT); Limited training data; Occupancy detections; Residential house; Sequence matching; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112444889

Nowadays, with the arrival of the era of big data, the MIoT architecture has been transformed from cloud computing architecture to edge computing architecture. However, due to the lack of trust among edge computing participants, new solutions with higher security need to be proposed. In the current solutions, some use blockchain technology to solve data security problems while some use federated learning technology to solve privacy problems, but these methods neither combine with the special environment of the ocean nor consider the security of task publishers. In this article, we propose a secure sharing method of MIoT data under an edge computing framework based on federated learning and blockchain technology. Combining its special distributed architecture with the MIoT edge computing architecture, federated learning ensures the privacy of nodes. The blockchain serves as a decentralized way, which stores federated learning workers to achieve nontampering and security. We propose a concept of quality and reputation as the metrics of selection for federated learning workers. Meanwhile, we design a quality proof mechanism [proof of quality (PoQ)] and apply it to the blockchain, making the edge nodes recorded in the blockchain more high-quality. In addition, a marine environment model is built in this article, and the analysis based on this model makes the method proposed in this article more applicable to the marine environment.

This article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection, data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features, followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being capable of working in both big data and real-time environments.

With the development of multi-agent systems (MASs), intelligent protection schemes have been introduced that operate on the basis of data processing by a central controller. However, the possibility of communication failure and cyber attacks reduce reliability of these protection systems. To address this problem, this paper proposes an intelligent protection scheme that relies on peer-to-peer communication between agents in the first layer of the MAS. In the case of communication failure, the agents react to the fault condition by using the available data for similar conditions. The main advantages of the proposed scheme are reduction of number of employed agents by using only relay agents and no need for communicating with higher layers of MAS. Implementation of the proposed scheme in the ETAP simulation model of a 14 bus active distribution network shows that data exchange between relay agents properly modifies the operating time of the relays, resulting in protection coordination between main and backup protections. © 2021 The Authors.

State estimation-based solutions provide a critical tool in monitoring and control of smart grids. Recently there has been an increased focus on false data injection attacks which can circumvent the traditional statistical bad data detection algorithm. Most of the research methodologies focus on the presence of FDIA in measurement set, whereas their exact locations remain unknown. To cater this issue, this paper proposes a deep learning architecture for detection of the exact locations of data intrusions in real-time. This deep learning model in association with traditional bad data detection algorithms is capable of detecting both structured as well as unstructured false data injection attacks. The deep learning architecture is not dependent on statistical assumptions of the measurements, it emphasizes on the inconsistency and co-occurrence dependency of potential attacks in measurement set, thus acting as a multilabel classifier. Such kind of architecture remains model free without any prior statistical assumptions. Extensive research work on IEEE test-bench shows that this scheme is capable of identifying the locations for intrusion under varying noise scenarios. Such kind of an approach shows potential results also in detection of presence of falsified data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cybersecurity; Deep learning; False data injection attack; Power system security; Smart grid; State estimation","Classification (of information); Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Location; Network security; Signal detection; Smart power grids; State estimation; Bad data detections; Cyber security; Deep learning; Detection algorithm; False data injection attacks; Learning architectures; Measurement sets; Multi-label classifications; Power systems security; Smart Grid technologies; Electric power transmission networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106346421

As a strategy to alleviate the escalation of resource congestion, collaborative edge computing (CEC) has become a new paradigm for solving the needs of the Internet of Things (IoT). CEC can provide computing, storage, and network connection resources for remote devices. Because the edge network is closer to the connected devices, it involves a large amount of users' privacy. This also makes edge networks face more and more security issues, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, unauthorized access, packet sniffing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To combat these issues and enhance the security of edge networks, we propose a deep learning-based intrusion detection algorithm. Based on the generative adversarial network (GAN), we designed a powerful intrusion detection method. Our intrusion detection method includes three phases. First, we use the feature selection module to process the collaborative edge network traffic. Second, a deep learning architecture based on GAN is designed for intrusion detection aiming at a single attack.

Exploiting this trace forensically requires a distance measure between pairs of attacks.

As millions of devices are connected over the internet, security becomes a more challenging issue in the Cloud-IoT environment. Many research works have contributed to ensuring security in Cloud-IoT. But none of the works has proven its security strength and efficiency. In particular, centralized authentication and complex encryption schemes increase the overhead even for low-level security. This paper proposes a novel Decentralized Blockchain-based Security (DeBlock-Sec) scheme, which is most suitable for resource-constrained IoT environment to abridge the security issue. The overall system works upon three significant phases, (1) authentication phase, (2) data encryption phase, and (3) data retrieval phase. For authentication, we propose a novel Decentralized Blockchain-based Authentication (DBA) protocol. The DBA protocol uses multiple factors to authenticate users and devices. In the next phase, data encryption is carried on the IoT devices. As the amount of data to be encrypted is large in size, the encryption is performed in the spark environment since the confidentiality of data is vital. The data retrieval phase allows users to access the data stored in the Cloud. Dendrimer Fractal Tree Indexing is followed to minimize the searching time and the Revised Diffie-Hellman algorithm is presented for key exchange. The extensive experiments performed in Spark environment show that the proposed work achieves better performance in terms of time consumption (encryption, decryption and search), storage space, and throughput.

The key RF-Mehndi novelty is that when the user's fingertip touching on the tag array surface during the communication, the backscattered signals by the tag array become user-dependent and unique. Hence, if we enhance the communication modality of many personal cards nowadays by RF-Mehndi, in case that a card gets lost or stolen, it cannot be used illegally by the adversaries. To harvest such a benefit, we leverage two key observations in designing RF-Mehndi. The first one is when tags are nearby, their interrogated currents can change each other's circuit characteristics, based on which unique phase features can be obtained from backscattered signals. The second observation is that when the user's fingertip touches the tag array surface during communication, the phase feature can be further profiled by this user. Based on these observations, the card and its holder can be potentially authenticated at the same time. To transfer the RF-Mehndi idea to a practical system, we further address technical challenges.

This is due to the variability and uncertainty characteristics of PV power. This makes automatic generation control (AGC) to be more challenging. In other words, maintaining system frequencies and tie-line power flows at the desired values, also known as 'tie-line bias control' is difficult. In this paper, an enhanced tie-line bias control method is proposed by predicting PV power generation and bus frequencies. A cyber-physical two-area power system with a large PV plant consisting of phasor measurement units (PMUs) is studied. The use of synchrophasor networks consisting of PMUs can enable smooth power system operations overcoming the challenges of PV power variability and uncertainty. However, the use of PMUs in power system control creates vulnerabilities for cyber-attacks that could jeopardize the power system operations. It is shown that the frequency prediction using a virtual synchrophasor network (VSN) can mitigate the impact(s) of denial of service (DoS) attacks on physical PMUs. Enhanced AGC performance is investigated under different weather and load conditions including a weather profile during the 'Great American Eclipse' of August 21{st}, 2017.

Existing security tools detect aggressive password guessing attacks (i.e., a high number of login attempts in a short duration of time). In order to evade detection, the attackers are guessing the logins in a slow manner (for example, a login attempt every few minutes/hours/days). These attacks are called as stealthy password guessing attacks. These attacks have caused damage to the company’s servers and try to exploit vulnerable IoT devices. The current literature detects stealthy distributed password guessing attacks, but no attempt is made to detect stealthy single-source password guessing attacks. The authors have proposed a cluster-based approach to handle this problem. The model uses a data set obtained from a honeypot system.

In this paper, we model and solve a joint problem of strategic workforce planning and fleet renewal in a military context. The joint problem studied involves addressing a trade-off among several costs (e.g., workforce, maintenance, operating, etc.) and operational readiness (availability) of the fleet. To make such trade-offs, the decisions associated with workforce planning (i.e., the recruitment and the career progression of the workforce) and fleet renewal (i.e., the timing of asset replacements) strategies have to be simultaneously considered and optimized. We develop a simulation-optimization approach by coupling a system dynamics (SD) simulation model and a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the joint problem. In the developed approach, the GA generates candidate workforce planning and fleet renewal strategies to find the best joint strategy. Then, the candidate workforce planning and renewal strategies are passed to the SD model which simulates both the career progression of the workforce and the life-cycle of assets to evaluate the total cost. We illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the joint model on a realistic case study motivated by the recent modernization efforts of the Royal Australian Navy. The results obtained indicate that this approach leads to a considerable cost reduction and identifies the causes of inferior performance.

It then leads to improper utilization of the overall resources, and hence experiences various security threats. Although transport layer security (TLS)-based solution is presently advocated in the said framework, it is vulnerable to many security threats like man-in-the-middle, replay, spoofing, privileged insider, impersonation, and denial-of-service attacks.

In several cases, the Internet of Things (IoT) applications that are time-sensitive require low response time. Thus, reducing the latency in IoT networks is one of the essential tasks. To this end, fog computing is developed with a motive for the data production and consumption to always be within proximity; therefore, the fog nodes must be placed at the edge of the network, which is near the end devices, such that the latency is minimized. The optimal location selection for fog node placement within a network out of a very large number of possibilities, such as minimize latency, is a challenging problem. So, it is a combinatorial optimization problem. Hard combinatorial optimization problems (NP-hard) involve huge discrete search spaces. The fog node placement problem is an NP-hard problem. NP-hard problems are often addressed by using heuristic methods and approximation algorithms. Combinatorial optimization problems can be viewed as searching for the best element of some set of discrete items; therefore in principle, any metaheuristic can be used to solve them. To resolve this, meta-heuristic-based methods is proposed. We apply the Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to design fog node placement algorithms. Genetic Algorithm is observed to give better solutions. Since Genetic Algorithm may get stuck in local optima, Hybrid Genetic Algorithm, and Simulated Annealing (GA-SA), Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (GA-PSO) were compared with GA.

Edge hosts do not always have access to enough global information to create the most optimal resource allocation strategy. Central servers do but at the cost of privacy. A solution is needed that can do both. This article, therefore, presents a novel resource allocation method called concurrent federated reinforcement learning.

The privacy security is also a growing problem. The existing works use earphones, covert, and user-friendly wearable devices, for user authentication. However, some of the earphone-based authentication solutions need to customize special earphones, which are not universal. Other solutions use microphones and speakers of earphones for authentication, which are susceptible to changes in the auricle's internal environment, resulting in a decline in performance. To solve this problem, a new authentication solution based on the existing commercial earphones is proposed to authenticate a user by tapping on the earphone rhythmically. This rhythmic tap behavior causes a change of the signal waveform of the built-in accelerometer in the earphone. Based on this, we design a pipeline to authenticate the user's identity. We first design an event detection algorithm to segment the tap signal accurately. Then, we use the global features calculated based on the event detection algorithm and local features extracted from the convolutional neural network (CNN) for building an authentication model using the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier. Finally, 20 users are recruited to evaluate the experiment and the recognition accuracy reaches 98%. Moreover, we extend the experiment to prove that it has a good performance against the different attacks and is robust in different scenarios. © 2014 IEEE.","Accelerometer; earphone; tap gesture; user authentication","Barium compounds; Convolutional neural networks; Earphones; Internet of things; Privacy by design; Signal detection; Wearable sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Authentication models; Authentication solutions; Event detection algorithm; Information transmission; Information-centric; Internet of thing (IOT); Recognition accuracy; User authentication; Authentication",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102314368

Actively pushing all content to users causes much unnecessary resource consumption in the UIoT. The information-centric networking (ICN) architecture opens new horizons up for these challenges. However, the slowness of underwater propagation speed makes traditional ICN not suitable for UIoT, especially considering about delay time. In this article, we propose an information-centric wireless sensor networking scheme with water-depth-aware content caching (ICWSN-WDA) to solve the above challenges. First, we design a naming scheme and a hybrid communication mode suitable for ICWSN-WDA. The communication mode in underwater we design is divided into push and pull traffic, which balances energy consumption and delay time. Second, we define a push level to decide which water depth the content actively pushes to, finding a suitable junction point of two modes. Third, as the water depth is deeper, it becomes more difficult to replace the sensor battery. To save energy consumption of deep-water sensors, the water-depth-aware caching mechanism is proposed based on water depth, popularity, and senor energy. Our extensive evaluation confirms the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, and it balances energy consumption constraints and latency. © 2014 IEEE.","Caching; information-centric networking (ICN); Underwater Internet of Things (UIoT); water-depth-awareness","Energy utilization; Marine communication; Wireless sensor networks; Communication mode; Energy consumption constraints; Hybrid communication modes; Information-centric; Information-centric networkings (ICN); Resource consumption; Underwater propagation; Wireless sensor networkings; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100839337

In general and during lockdown phases, people worldwide use social media network to state their viewpoints and general feelings concerning the pandemic that has hampered their daily lives. Twitter is one of the most commonly used social media platforms, and it showed a massive increase in tweets related to coronavirus, including positive, negative, and neutral tweets, in a minimal period. The researchers move toward the sentiment analysis and analyze the various emotions of the public toward COVID-19 due to the diverse nature of tweets. Meanwhile, people have expressed their feelings regarding the vaccinations' safety and effectiveness on social networking sites such as Twitter. As an advanced step, in this paper, our proposed approach analyzes COVID-19 by focusing on Twitter users who share their opinions on this social media networking site. The proposed approach analyzes collected tweets' sentiments for sentiment classification using various feature sets and classifiers. The early detection of COVID-19 sentiments from collected tweets allow for a better understanding and handling of the pandemic. Tweets are categorized into positive, negative, and neutral sentiment classes. We evaluate the performance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) classifiers using evaluation metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score).

Intrusion Systems are crucial in e-healthcare since the patients' medical records should be kept highly secure, confidential, and accurate. Any change in the actual patient data can lead to errors in the diagnosis and treatment. Most of the existing artificial intelligence-based systems are trained on outdated intrusion detection repositories, which can produce more false positives and require retraining the algorithm from scratch to support new attacks. These processes also make it challenging to secure patient records in medical systems as the intrusion detection mechanisms can become frequently obsolete. This paper proposes a hybrid framework using Deep Learning named “ImmuneNet” to recognize the latest intrusion attacks and defend healthcare data. The proposed framework uses multiple feature engineering processes, oversampling methods to improve class balance, and hyper-parameter optimization techniques to achieve high accuracy and performance. The architecture contains <1 million parameters, making it lightweight, fast, and IoT-friendly, suitable for deploying the IDS on medical devices and healthcare systems. The performance of ImmuneNet was benchmarked against several other machine learning algorithms on the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity's Intrusion Detection System 2017, 2018, and Bell DNS 2021 datasets which contain extensive real-time and latest cyber attack data. Out of all the experiments, ImmuneNet performed the best on the CIC Bell DNS 2021 dataset with about 99.19% accuracy, 99.22% precision, 99.19% recall, and 99.2% ROC-AUC scores, which are comparatively better and up-to-date than other existing approaches in classifying between requests that are normal, intrusion, and other cyber attacks.

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory survey in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry involving over 100 organizations in Italy was conducted. Results were analysed through one-way analysis of variance, to appraise the differences in the perceptions of the various actors of the FMCG supply chain (Manufacturers, Logistics Service Providers, Retailers). Findings: While a certain degree of alignment of the perceptions across the FMCG supply chain exists, the study found that Logistics Service Providers can play a crucial role as orchestrators of the CSCRM process towards a more “supply chain-oriented” response to cyber threats and risk events. The research also highlights the necessity to see people as key elements for improving cyber resilience in the supply chain. Research limitations/implications: Through a vertical analysis of a supply chain, the study extends the existing theory on CSCRM, which contains isolated case studies. It also contributes to extending the current theory with the proposal of the paradigm of Logistics Service Providers as orchestrators of the CSCRM process. The study combines different classifications of CSCRM initiatives and embraces theories external to the supply chain literature. Practical implications: Through the empirical analysis, this study helps practitioners in streamlining the design of cyber security strategies and actions that span across the supply chain for better alignment. This could mean more coordination of efforts and more targeted/accurate investments in CSCRM initiatives. The study invites practitioners to ponder the perceived relevance of the human factor as a source of risk and the perceived importance of countermeasures aimed at mitigating risk events stemming from that source. Originality/value: By focusing on an entire supply chain, this is one of the first studies on CSCRM that goes beyond the dyad. Its originality also lies in its use of the investigations of perceptions along the supply chain as pillars for the alignment of CSCRM strategies and mitigation initiatives. This original perspective allows for discovering the role of Logistics Service Providers in driving the alignment of the efforts towards better outcomes of the CSCRM process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cyber risk; Cyber security; Information risk; Information systems; Resilience; Risk management; Supply-chain management; Surveys",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106337918

Then, the PSO is used to update the position of particles by encoding them and calculating the fitness values to find the optimal solution of the task offloading strategies, which greatly reduces the energy consumption during the task allocation process in the system. Finally, the simulations are conducted to compare the proposed method with two other algorithms in terms of the average time delay and energy consumption under different numbers of user mobile devices and data transmission rates. The simulation results showed that the average time delay and energy consumption of the proposed method are the smallest in different cases. And, the average delay and energy consumption are 0.205 s and 0.2 J, respectively, when the number of users' mobile devices is 80, which are better than the other two comparison algorithms.

As a result, an efficient security mechanism is essential to protect against various and unknown cyber-attacks. In this article, we propose a certificate-based signature scheme based on hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC), with the aim of improving security while reducing computational and communication costs in the IIoT environment.

Denial of service (Dos) is a phenomenon in which a large number of useless data packets or obstructive content are maliciously transmitted to the target server, which makes the target server unable to provide users with normal services. Denial of service attack (Dos attack) is a very typical network attack method, and the main harm of Dos attack is to exhaust service resources, making the computer or network unable to provide normal services. And AKN (adaptive Kohonen network) is an adaptive neural network proposed in recent years, and an algorithm summarized by using the characteristics of the neural network is called the AKN algorithm. This algorithm can realize fast, low-consumption, and high-precision denial of service detection in complex networks. In the era of big data, network security is becoming more and more important, and in order to maintain the security of network data, this article studies the common forms and principles of Dos attacks, as well as the current corresponding defense detection methods. It also investigates several commonly used algorithms of computer data mining technology, such as clustering algorithms, classification algorithms, neural network algorithms, regression algorithms, website data mining, and association algorithms, and proposes a computer data mining model based on the AKN algorithm. In addition, the computer data mining technology based on the AKN algorithm is used to conduct defensive detection experiments under Dos attacks and compares with classic algorithms. Experimental results show that experiments based on the AKN algorithm have better defensive detection effects than classic algorithms, with a detection accuracy rate of more than 97% and a detection efficiency improvement of more than 20%. © 2022 Xiang Huang.",,"Clustering algorithms; Complex networks; Data mining; Network security; Classic algorithm; Data mining technology; Data packet; Denial of Service; Denialof- service attacks; Kohonen network; Network algorithms; Network security problems; Network society; Technology-based; Denial-of-service attack",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125147781

Although experimental results showed that these classification models could produce higher accuracy in predicting network attacks on the offline datasets, compared with the operational intrusion detection systems, machine learning is rarely deployed in the real intrusion detection environment. This is what we call the last mile problem with the machine learning approach to network intrusion detection, the discrepancy between the strength and requirements of machine learning and network operational semantics. In this paper, we aim to bridge the aforementioned gap. In particular, an LCC-RF-RFEX feature selection approach is proposed to select optimal features of the specific type of attacks from dataset, and then, an intrusion-specific approach is introduced to convert them into detection patterns that can be used by the nonmachine-learning detector for the corresponding specific attack detection in the real-world network environment. To substantiate our approach, we take Snort, KDDCup'99 dataset, and Dos attacks as the experimental subjects to demonstrate how to close the last-mile gap. For the specific type of Dos attacks in the KDDCup'99 dataset, we use the LCC-RF-RFEX method to select optimal feature subset and utilize our intrusion-specific approach to generate new rules in Snort by using them. Comparing performance differences between the existing Snort rule set and our augmented Snort rule set with regard to Dos attacks, the experimental results showed that our approach expanded Snort's detection capability of Dos attacks, on average, reduced up to 25.28% false-positive alerts for Teardrop attacks and Synflood attacks, and decreased up to 98.87% excessive alerts for Mail bomb attacks. © 2022 Xibin Sun et al.",,"Classification (of information); Denial-of-service attack; Feature extraction; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network security; Classification models; High-accuracy; In networks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Last mile; Machine learning applications; Machine-learning; Networks security; Rule set; Specific detection; Semantics",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125120952

Software vulnerabilities lead to intrusions that cause data breaches and result in disclosure of sensitive data, compromising the organizations' reputation that translates into, financial losses and compromising software usability as well. Most of the data breaches are financially motivated, especially in the healthcare sector. The cyber invaders continuously penetrate the E- Health data because of the high cost of the data on the dark web. Therefore, security assessment of healthcare web-based applications demands immediate intervention mechanisms to weed out the threats of cyber-attacks for the sake of software usability. The proposed disclosure is a unique process of three phases that are combined by researchers in order to produce and manage usability management framework for healthcare information system. In this most threatened time of digital era where, Healthcare data industry has borne the brunt of the highest number of data breach episodes in the last few years. The key reason for this is attributed to the sensitivity of healthcare data and the high costs entailed in trading the data over the dark web. Hence, usability management of healthcare information systems is the need of hour as to identify the vulnerabilities and provide preventive measures as a shield against the breaches. The proposed unique developed model of usability management workflow is prepared by associating steps like learn; analyze and manage.

Firstly, efficient lightweight cipher designs are elaborated and validated. Then, the proposed cryptographic instructions (PRESENT and PRINCE) are integrated into the default instruction set architecture of the ReonV processor core. The instruction set extensions (ISE) of lightweight cipher modules can be instantiated in software routines exactly as the instructions of the base architecture. A single instruction is needed to implement a full lightweight cryptographic instruction.

Identifying the device type helps secure the device safe. But, existing device identification methods have difficulty in distinguishing fine-grained types of devices. To address this challenge, we propose a fine-grained identification method based on the camera devices' inherent features. First, feature selection is based on the coverage and differences of the inherent features type. Second, the features are classified according to their representation. A design feature similarity calculation strategy (FSCS) for each type of feature is established. Then the feature weights are determined based on feature entropy. Finally, we present a device similarity model based on the FSCS and feature weights. And we use this model to identify the fine-grained type of a target device. We have evaluated our method on Dahua and Hikvision camera devices. The experimental results show that we can identify the device's fine-grained type when some inherent feature values are missing.

However, the ML approach usually faces three challenges: massive attack variants, imbalanced data issues, and appropriate data segmentation. Improper handling of the issues will significantly degrade ML performance, e.g., resulting in high false-negative and low recall rates. Despite many efforts have done in the literature, detecting security attacks in a complicated network environment with imperfect data collection is still an open issue. This work proposes a machine learning framework with a combination of a variational autoencoder and multilayer perceptron model to deal with imbalanced datasets and detect the explosion of attack variants on the Internet. The detection engine also includes an efficient range-based sequential search algorithm to address the segmentation challenge in data pre-processing from multiple sources (network packets, system/statistic logs) effectively. Our work is the first attempt to demonstrate the effect of using an appropriate combination of ML models for boosting IDS detection capability in a heterogeneous environment, where data collection imperfection is common.

Even better, we found that the proposed treatment of imbalanced datasets can improve up to 35% on the F1 score and 27% on recall rate.

Its power concerns, ethical perspectives, including the issues of digital sensing, actuation, mobility, efficient processcomputation, and wireless communication will require advanced neuromorphic process variable controls. Existing home automated robots lack memristic associative memory. This work presents Cyber-Physical Home Automation System (CPHAS) using Memristive Reconfigurable Algorithmic State Machine (MRASM) chart. A process control architecture that supports Concurrent Wireless Data Streams and Power-Transfer (CWDSPT) is developed. Unlike legacy systems with powersplitting (PS) and time-switching (TS) controls, the MRASM- ROBOT explores granular wireless signal controls through unmodulated high-power continuous wave (CW). This transmits infinite process variables using Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code (OSTBC) for interference reduction. The CWDSPT transmitter and receiver circuit design for signal processing are implemented with complexity noise-error reduction during telemetry data decoding. Received signals are error-buffered while gathering control variables’ status. Transceiver Memristive neuromorphic circuits are introduced for computational acceleration in the design. Hardware circuit design is tested for system reliability considering the derived schematic models for all process variables. Under small range space diversity, the system demonstrated significant memory stabilization at the synchronous iteration of the synaptic circuitry. © 2022","Cloud computing; complex robot; computational science; cyber-physical systems; IoT; machine learning","Automation; Continuous time systems; Embedded systems; Energy transfer; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Memory architecture; Process control; Real time systems; Signal processing; Algorithmic state machines; Cloud-computing; Complex robot; Computational science; Cyber physicals; Data stream; Power transfers; Process Variables; Reconfigurable; Wireless data; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124677666

The various attributes of Python have made it attractive to numerous malware authors. Attackers often embed malicious shell commands into Python scripts for illegal operations. However, traditional static analysis methods are not feasible to detect this kind of attack because they focus on common features and failure in finding those malicious commands. On the other hand, dynamic analysis is not optimal in this case for its time-consuming and inefficient. In this paper, we propose PyComm, a model for detecting malicious commands in Python scripts with multidimensional features based on machine learning, which considers both 12 statistical features and string sequences of Python source code. Meanwhile, three comparison experiments are designed to evaluate the validity of proposed method.

Through the investigation of network security managers, this article uses structured modeling technology to derive the system's logical business functions, which are data acquisition function, data analysis function, and post-processing function. This study uses a three-tier architecture to design the system, describes the system data business processing flow, and gives the key flow of the K-means algorithm application. In addition, the system database is designed to provide support for system data processing. This study proposes a dual-network text matching model based on local interactive components. This model composes two modalities of single-modal short text data: a positional structural modal for describing local interactions and a global semantic understanding modal for extracting global semantic information. Two heterogeneous networks are used to extract two modalities. The principle of complementarity of modalities is realized by constructing the differences of each modal. At the same time, through the attention mechanism, the position information of the position structure modal is transferred to the global semantic understanding modal to obtain consistent comprehensive information so as to realize the principle of modal consistency. On this basis, by designing low-order interaction functions and high-order interaction functions, and using long- and short-term memory networks, we have, respectively, improved the position structure modal and global semantic understanding modal. The theoretical analysis and simulation results of the model show that the propagation characteristics of the network worm are completely determined by the threshold R0 required for its existence. When R0 >1, the network worm will become popular even with a small initial infection number; conversely, even if the initial infection machine is large, the network worm will eventually become extinct. The research results of this article also show that the introduction of mobile devices has an important impact on the defense technology of network worms. To curb network worms that use both the network and mobile devices to spread, and to increase the proportion of machines that have never been infected with the virus, the most effective method is to control the number of mobile devices and reduce the possibility of cross-infection between mobile devices and machines. The simulation results show that, regardless of whether dynamic isolation and antivirus software are considered, the local area network-based choke method given in this study can effectively curb intelligent network worms that have slow scanning rates and clear scanning targets. In addition, the choke method presented in this article can determine the choke threshold without affecting the normal network scanning behavior of users in the local area network. © 2022 Jinhuan Hou and Fuqiang Ding.",,"Client server computer systems; Computer software; Computer viruses; Data mining; Heterogeneous networks; K-means clustering; Network security; Semantics; Data mining technology; Defence systems; Design and analysis; Interaction functions; K-mean algorithms; Multi-modal data; Network virus; Network worms; Semantics understanding; Structure modal; Modal analysis",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124418419

However, network administrators cannot cover all security equipment due to the cyberspace management cost constraints, giving attackers the chance to escape from the surveillance of network security administrators by legitimate actions and to perform the attack in both physical domain and digital domain. Therefore, we proposed a hidden attack sequence detection method based on reinforcement learning to deal with the challenge through modeling the network administrators as an intelligent agent that learns their action policy from the interaction with the cyberspace environment. Following Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), the intelligent agent can not only discover the hidden attackers hiding in the legitimate action sequences but also reduce the cyberspace management cost. Furthermore, a dynamic reward DDPG method was proposed to improve defense performance, which set dynamic reward depending on the hidden attack sequences steps and agent's check steps, compared to the fixed reward in common methods. Meanwhile, the method was verified in a simulated experimental cyberspace environment. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that there are hidden attack sequences in cyberspace, and the proposed method can discover the hidden attack sequences. The dynamic reward DDPG shows superior performance in detecting hidden attackers, with a detection rate of 97.46%, which can improve the ability to discover hidden attackers and reduce the 6% cyberspace management cost compared to DDPG. © 2022 Lei Zhang et al.",,"Cost reduction; Intelligent agents; Reinforcement learning; Signal detection; Attack sequences; Cyberspaces; Detection methods; Deterministics; Management costs; Network administrator; ON dynamics; Performance; Policy gradient; Sequence detection; Network security",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124407161

In this attack, the attacker uses botnets to overwhelm network resources. Botnets can be randomly compromised computers or IoT devices that are used to generate excessive traffic towards the victim, and as a result, legitimate users cannot access the services. In this research, software-defined networking (SDN) has been suggested as a solution to fight DDoS attacks. SDN uses the idea of centralized control and segregation of the data plane from the control plane. SDN is more flexible, and policy implementation on the centralized controller is easy. SDN is now being widely used in modern network paradigms because it has enhanced security. In this work, an entropy-based statistical approach has been suggested to detect and mitigate TCP SYN flood DDoS attacks. The proposed algorithm uses a three-phased detection scheme to minimize the false-positive rate. Entropy, standard deviation, and weighted moving average have been used for intrusion detection.

To the best of our knowledge, such a design of experiment has never been tested rigorously on a honeypot implementation except for self-reporting tests applied to hackers in the literature. However, no study evaluates the actual data of these hackers and these tests. This study also provides a honeypot design to understand the personality and expertise of the hacker and displays the correlation of these data with the tests. Our Honeypsy system is composed of a Big-5 personality test, a cyber expertise test, and a capture-the-flag (CTF) event to collect logs with honeypot applied in this sequence. These three steps generate data on the expertise and psychology of known cyber hackers. The logs of the known hacker activities on honeypots are obtained through the CTF event that they have participated in. The design and deployment of a honeypot, as well as the CTF event, were specifically prepared for this research. Our aim is to predict an unknown hacker's expertise and personality by analyzing these data. By examining/analyzing the data of the known hackers, it is now possible to make predictions about the expertise and personality of the unknown hackers.

Many countries are also making use of Internet of Thing technology to carry out intelligent electricity network reform. One of the reform goals is balancing the supply and demand of electricity, which has become a top priority. Balancing electricity supply and demand through real-time electricity prices has become an effective way. However, using traditional machine learning models for real-time electricity price prediction requires complex feature engineering, and the results are not satisfactory. Also, the mainstream fusion methods use data-level fusion, which will put very high pressure on communication bandwidth and computer resources. In this paper, an LSTM- (long short-term memory-) based decision level fusion of multisource data is proposed and applied for real-time electricity price prediction on actual electricity price datasets. The method solves the difficulties of traditional machine learning models in dealing with complex nonlinear problems. It achieves local asynchronous processing of multisource data through decision-level fusion, reducing the requirement for bandwidth resources and providing perfect results in real-time electricity price prediction. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of the decision fusion prediction model based on LSTM is higher than that of the linear regression algorithm. © 2022 Ke Xie et al.",,"Balancing; Bandwidth; Complex networks; Data fusion; Economics; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Bandwidth resource; Decision level fusion; Electricity networks; Electricity prices; Internet of things technologies; Machine learning models; Multisource data; Price forecasts; Price prediction; Real- time; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124385284

If the multimedia information obtained by the IoT device is tampered with, the subsequent information processing will be affected, resulting in an incorrect service and even security threat. Therefore, it is very necessary to study multimedia forensics technology for IoT security. In the edge-cloud IoT environment, an image anomaly detection technology for security service is proposed in this paper. First, preprocessing is performed before image anomaly detection. Then, we extracted sparse features from the image to roughly localize the region of anomaly detection. Feature extraction based on the polar cosine transform (PCT) is then performed only on the candidate region of anomaly detection. To further improve the detection accuracy, we use iterative updating. This method makes use of the feature that the edge node is closer to the multimedia source in physical location and migrates the complex computing task of image anomaly detection from the cloud computing center to the edge node. Provide a security service for abnormal data and deploy it to the edge-cloud server to reduce the pressure on the cloud.

To prevent confidential data from getting in the hands of an attacker, some measures need to be taken. Here comes the need for an effective system, which can classify the traffic as an attack or normal. Intrusion Detection Systems can do this work with perfection. Many machine learning algorithms are used to develop efficient IDS. These IDS provide remarkable results. However, ensemble-based IDS using voting have been seen to outperform individual approaches (Support Vector Machine and ExtraTree). Since the Voting methodology is able to work around both, theoretically similar and different classifiers and produce a single classifier based on the majority characteristics, it proved to be better than the other ensemble based techniques. In this paper, an ensemble IDS implementation is presented based on the voting ensemble method, using the two algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVC) and ExtraTree.

This growth brings up several challenging issues for a successful continuous operation of IoT applications. Some of these challenges that need to be taken care of are resource constraints, central server overload, and the risk of illegal use of private data. On the other side, Blockchain technology is increasingly popular and has gained huge success in cryptocurrencies. It offers numerous vital qualities such as a technique for consensus, peer communications, confidence-building without a trustworthy third party, and a transaction controlled by conditions and functions using the intelligent contract technique. Blockchain is an excellent candidate to establish a decentralized, autonomous IoT system addressing the above issues. This study proposes an IoT-Blockchain integration architecture using an Ethereum Blockchain infrastructure within a rich-thin client IoT approach to address the challenges created by the limited IoT resources while implementing the Blockchain mining technique in IoT systems. The architecture depends on load distribution between the resources. Limited resource devices are the thin-clients, while the higher resource devices are assigned as rich-clients. Both clients can access the blockchain and collect the data, but rich-client can only execute the mining process. In addition, we implement a healthcare system based on the proposed architecture in which surgical process management is carried out. We also prove our solution's efficiency by testing and comparing the architecture against other well-known IoT-based blockchain architectures.

However, it hides the characteristics of the data, increases the difficulty of detecting malicious traffic, and protects such malicious behavior. Therefore, encryption alone cannot fundamentally guarantee information security. It is also necessary to monitor traffic to detect malicious actions. At present, the more commonly used traffic classification methods are the method based on statistical features and the method based on graphs. However, these two methods are not always reliable when they are applied to the problem of encrypted malicious traffic detection due to their limitations. The former only focuses on the internal information of the network flow itself and ignores the external connections between the network flows. The latter is just the opposite. This paper proposes an encrypted malicious traffic detection method based on a graph convolutional network (GCN) called GCN-ETA, which considers the statistical features (internal information) of network flows and the structural information (external connections) between them. GCN-ETA consists of two parts: a feature extractor that uses an improved GCN and a classifier that uses a decision tree. Improving on the traditional GCN, the effect and speed of encrypted malicious traffic detection can be effectively improved and the deployment of the detection model in the real environment is increased, which provides a reference for the application of GCN in similar scenarios. This method has achieved excellent performance in experiments using real-world encrypted network traffic data for malicious traffic detection, with the accuracy, AUC, and F1-score exceeding 98% and more than 1,300 flows detected per second. © 2022 Juan Zheng et al.",,"Decision trees; Flow graphs; Network security; Confidential information; Convolutional networks; Higher efficiency; Malicious traffic; Network communications; Network traffic; Networks flows; Secure networks; Statistical features; Traffic detection; Cryptography",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124150147

Three types of models were designed for the simulation testing of the NCS: a combat-management model for simulating the overall computational activities, physical models to confirm the intrasubsystem behaviors, and data integration models to test the intersubsystem communications. These models are realized with the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern, which strongly facilitates graphical user interfaces being decoupled from model logic and data.

The trend is going high due to an increase in Internet users. Similarly, there is a rapid growth of numbers in mobile devices in the working environments and on most official occasions. The trends pose a huge threat to users since they become the prime target of attackers. More unfortunately, mobile devices have weak security measures due to their limited computational powers. Current approaches to detect spoofing attacks focus on personal computers and rely on the network hosts' capacity, leaving guest users with mobile devices at risk. Some approaches on Android-based devices demand root privilege, which is highly discouraged. This paper presents an Android-based client-side solution to detect the presence of fake access points in a perimeter using details collected from probe responses. Our approach considers the difference in security information and signal level of an access point (AP). We present the detection in three networks, (i) open networks, (ii) closed networks and (iii) networks with captive portals. As a departure from existing works, our solution does not require root access for detection, and it is developed for portability and better performance.

How to realize the robust and reliable connection of massive IoT applications has become the research focus of industry and academia. However, the massive IoT industrial equipment, diverse business types, complex networking mode, and broadcast characteristics of wireless media have posed serious challenges to providing stable and reliable connections in industrial communication scenarios. In order to overcome this problem, the paper proposes an enhanced reliable access scheme (ERAS) for massive IoT applications in software-defined industrial heterogeneous networks. Based on the idea of software-defined networking (SDN), the ERAS is designed from two perspectives of the control plane and the data plane. Based on the idea of greedy algorithms, ERAS uses priority, interference set, deadline, and other information to find the local optimal solution and then obtain the global optimum. First, low-priority periodic data is accessed to the channel based on the earliest deadline. Then, high-priority data (such as control and interactive services) judges the channel occupancy status according to the access flow table, and if there is an idle channel in the current time slot, it is normally accessed. Otherwise, the subslots reserved with high priority in the control channel are used to preempt the low-priority channel. This preemption mechanism can ensure reliable and real-time connections for massive IIoT. Simulation results show that the ERAS performs better than traditional methods in terms of delay, deadline guarantee rate, and packet loss rate. © 2022 Yuhuai Peng et al.",,"5G mobile communication systems; Application programs; Complex networks; Control equipment; Internet of things; Access schemes; Automated control; Generation technologies; Higher integration; Industrial systems; Intelligent Manufacturing; Intelligent terminal; Low priorities; Reliable connections; Sensor technologies; Heterogeneous networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124099725

In this research, a CUCKOO-ANN based optimization technique is applied to obtain a more efficient and dependable energy efficient solution in IoT-WSN. The proposed method uses time constraints to minimize the distance between sources and sink with the objective of a low-cost path. Using the property of CUCKOO method for solving nonlinear problem and utilizing the ANN parallel handling capability, this method is formulated.

Currently, image superresolution reconstruction technologies are widely used for obtaining high quality images. Unfortunately, the existing methods generally focus on the whole image without highlighting foreground information and lack visual focus. Also, they have low utilization of shallow features and numerous training parameters. In this paper, we propose a feature extraction module that focuses on foreground information: the parallel attention module (PAM). PAM computes channel and spatial attention in parallel, inputs the obtained attention values into a cascaded gated network, and dynamically adjusts the weights of both using nonuniform joint loss to focus on image foreground information and detail features to improve the reconstructed image's foreground sharpness. To further improve the performance, we propose to connect multiple PAM modules in series with skip connections and call it PAMNet. PAMNet can better leverage the shallow residual features, and the reconstructed images are closer to ground truth. Thereby, the applications in the urban image processing IoT systems can obtain high-resolution images more quickly and precisely. The comprehensive experimental results show that PAMNet performs better than the state-of-the-art technologies. © 2022 Yanfen Cheng et al.",,"Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Network security; Optical resolving power; Smart city; Autonomous Vehicles; Foreground information; High quality; High resolution; Image super-resolution reconstruction; Images processing; Information-aware; Reconstructed image; Smart technology; Urban surveillance; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124073694

In addition, the dependency on LBS in the performance of daily tasks has increased dramatically, especially after the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. LBS users use their real location to build LBS queries to take benefits. This makes location privacy vulnerable to attacks. The privacy issue is accentuated if the attacker is an LBS provider since all information about users is accessible. Moreover, the attacker can apply advanced attacks, such as map matching and semantic location attacks. In response to these issues, this work employs artificial intelligence to build a robust defense against advanced location privacy attacks. The key idea behind protecting the location privacy of LBS users is to generate smart dummy locations. Smart dummy locations are false locations with the same query probability as the real location, but they are far from both the real location and each other. Relying on the previous two conditions, the deep-learning-based intelligent finder ensures a high level of location privacy protection against advanced attacks. The attacker cannot recognize the dummies from the real location and cannot isolate the real location by a filtering process. In terms of entropy (the privacy protection metric), accuracy (the deep learning metric), and total execution time (the performance metric) and compared to the well-known DDA and BDA systems, the proposed system shows better results, where entropy = 15.9, accuracy = 9.9, and total execution time = 17 sec. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Nowadays, every company owns and operates an ITS, but detailed information about the system is rarely publicly available. However, there are many situations where the availability of such data would be beneficial. For example, cyber ranges need descriptions of complex realistic IT systems in order to provide an effective training and education platform. Furthermore, various algorithms in cybersecurity, in particular attack tree generation, need to be validated on realistic models of IT systems. In this paper, we describe a system we call the Generator that, based on the high-level requirements such as the number of employees and the business area the target company belongs to, generates a model of an ITS that satisfies the given requirements. We put special emphasis on the following two criteria: the generated ITS models a large amount of details, and ideally resembles a real system. Our survey of related literature found no sufficiently similar prior works, so we believe that this is the first attempt of building something like this. We created a proof-of-concept implementation of the Generator, validated it by generating ITS models for a simplified fictional financial institution, and analyzed the Generators performance with respect to the problem size. The research was done in an iterative manner, with coauthors continuously providing feedback on intermediate results. The conducted experiments show that our approach is feasible.

Cyber attackers seek to exploit vulnerabilities in network architecture to steal valuable information or disrupt computer resources. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is used to effectively detect various attacks, thus providing timely protection to network resources from these attacks. To implement NIDS, a stream of supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches is applied to detect irregularities in network traffic and to address network security issues. Such NIDSs are trained using various datasets that include attack traces. However, due to the advancement in modern-day attacks, these systems are unable to detect the emerging threats. Therefore, NIDS needs to be trained and developed with a modern comprehensive dataset which contains contemporary common and attack activities. This paper presents a framework in which different machine learning classification schemes are employed to detect various types of network attack categories. Five machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and Artificial Neural Networks, are used for attack detection. This study uses a dataset published by the University of New South Wales (UNSW-NB15), a relatively new dataset that contains a large amount of network traf fi c data with nine categories of network attacks. The results show that the classification models achieved the highest accuracy of 89.29% by applying the Random Forest algorithm. Further improvement in the accuracy of classification models is observed when Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to address the class imbalance problem.

The devices connected to the network must be controlled by the manager. For this purpose, many schemes are proposed to identify IoT devices, especially the schemes working on the gateway. However, almost all researchers do not pay close attention to the cost. Thus, considering the gateway's limited storage and computational resources, a new lightweight IoT device identification scheme is proposed. First, the DFI (deep/dynamic flow inspection) technology is utilized to efficiently extract flow-related statistical features based on in-depth studies. Then, combined with symmetric uncertainty and correlation coefficient, we proposed a novel filter feature selection method based on NSGA-III to select effective features for IoT device identification. We evaluate our proposed method by using a real smart home IoT data set and three different ML algorithms. The experimental results showed that our proposed method is lightweight and the feature selection algorithm is also effective, only using 6 features can achieve 99.5% accuracy with a 3-minute time interval. © 2022 Ruizhong Du et al.",,"Automation; Digital storage; Feature extraction; Gateways (computer networks); Computational resources; Dynamic flows; Feature-based; Flow features; Identification scheme; In-depth study; Inspection technology; Limited storage; Statistical features; Storage resources; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124022552

Especially IoT-based safety and critical applications must be more securable and reliable. Such type of applications needs to be operated continuously even in the presence of errors and faults. In safety and critical IoT applications maintaining data reliability and security is the critical task. IoT suffers from node failures due to limited resources and the nature of deployment which results in data loss consequently. This paper proposes a Data Recovery Approach for Fault Tolerant (DRAFT) IoT node algorithm, which is fully distributed, data replication and recovery implemented through redundant local database storage of other nodes in the network. DRAFT ensures high data availability even in the presence of node failures to preserve the data. When an IoT node fails in any cluster in the network data can be retrieved through redundant storage with the help of neighbor nodes in the cluster. The proposed algorithm is simulated for 100-150 IoT nodes which enhances 5% of network lifetime, and throughput.

Ensuring smart space safety is therefore critically important to successfully deliver intimate and convenient services surrounding our daily lives.

The internet is smoothly changing from an internet of people towards an Internet of Things, which permits various objects to connect to another wirelessly. The energy consumption of the IoT routing protocol can affect the network life span. In addition, the high volume of data produced by IoT will result in transmission collision, security issues, and energy dissipation due to increased data redundancy because tiny sensors are usually hard to recharge after they are deployed. Generally, to save energy, data aggregation reduces data redundancy at each node by turning some nodes into sleep mode and others into wake mode. Therefore, it is important to group the nodes with high data similarity using the fuzzy matrix. Then, the data received from the member nodes at the Cluster Head (CH) are analyzed using a fuzzy similarity matrix for clustering. In the next step, after clustering, some nodes are chosen from all groups as redundant nodes. The sleep scheduling mechanism is then applied to reduce data redundancy, network traffic jamming, and transmission costs. We have proposed an Energy-Efficient Data Aggregation Mechanism (EEDAM) secured by blockchain, which uses a data aggregation mechanism at the cluster level to save energy. As edge computing is used to provide on-demand trusted services to IoT with minimum delay, blockchain is integrated inside a cloud server, so the edge is validated by the blockchain to provide secure services to IoT. Finally, we performed simulations to calculate the performance of the proposed mechanism and compared it with the conventional energy-efficient algorithms. The simulation results show that the proposed structural design can successfully reduce the amount of data, provide proper security to the IoT, and extend the wireless sensor network (WSN). © 2013 IEEE.","availability; blockchain; Edge computing; energy efficiency; IoT systems; security; wireless sensor networks","Availability; Blockchain; Cloud security; Computer architecture; Cost reduction; Data reduction; Edge computing; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Green computing; Internet of things; Matrix algebra; Network architecture; Network security; Power management (telecommunication); Redundancy; Sensor nodes; Structural design; Aggregation mechanism; Block-chain; Cloud-computing; Data aggregation; Edge computing; Internet of thing system; Security; Energy efficiency",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123737399

This raises the need for efficient management of bare-metal clouds to keep operational costs low such as by reducing energy consumption. For efficiently managing the cloud infrastructure, bare-metal cloud operators need to monitor the utilization of servers. However, the privacy and security concerns prohibit the installation of third-party monitoring agents on the servers; thus, finding the server-utilization becomes a challenge. In this work, we present NASCENT, a scalable machine-learning (ML) based non-invasive solution for finding the utilization of servers without compromising the privacy and security of bare-metal cloud tenants. Our key idea is to infer utilization from various sensor readings accessible via a server's baseboard management controller (BMC) hardware. We evaluate the proposed solution with three regression based supervised ML algorithms in a Bare-metal-as-a-service (BMaaS) cloud. Our experimental evaluation shows that one of the ML algorithms employed in NASCENT infers the utilization with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) between 2.9 to 9.3 for different workloads. Also, the proposed solution uses minimal memory resources (19 KB) and can even run on BMC hardware which has very limited memory. We also propose a BMaaS cloud architecture that seamlessly integrates automated training and deployment of the ML algorithm in our solution into the life-cycle of bare-metal servers.

These models allow analysts to identify these operations and to understand how they are executed. However, there is a lack of an equivalent model from a defensive point of view: This is, there is no common sequence of actions for the detection of threats and their accurate response. This lack causes not only problems such as unstructured approaches and conceptual errors but, what is most important, inefficiency in the detection and response to threats, as defensive tactics are not well identified. For this reason, in this work we present a defensive kill chain approach where tactics for teams in charge of cyber defense activities are structured and arranged. We introduce the concept of SOC Critical Path (SCP), a novel kill chain model to detect and neutralize threats. SCP is a technology-independent model that provides an arrangement of mandatory steps, in the form of tactics, to be executed by Computer Network Defense teams to detect hostile cyber operations. By adopting this novel model, these teams increase the performance and the effectiveness of their capabilities through a common framework that formalizes the steps to follow for the detection and neutralization of threats.

As a de facto standard for in-vehicle network communication, the Controller Area Network (CAN) has become a target of cyber attacks. Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is considered as an effective approach to secure CAN and detect malicious attacks. Currently, there are two primary approaches used for intrusion detection: rule-based and machine learning-based. Rule-based approach is efficient but limited in the detection accuracy while machine learning-based detection has comparably higher detection accuracy but higher computation cost at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid IDS that combines the benefits of both rule-based and machine learning-based approaches. More specifically, we use machine learning methods to achieve a high detection rate while keeping the low computational requirement by offsetting the detection with a rule-based component. Our experiments with CAN traces collected from four different vehicle models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid IDS. © 2013 IEEE.","Automotive security; controller area network (CAN); in-vehicle network; intrusion detection","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Control system synthesis; Controllers; Cost engineering; Cybersecurity; Hidden Markov models; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Process control; Automotive security; Automotives; Controller area network; Controller-area network; Detection accuracy; Hidden-Markov models; In-vehicle networks; Intrusion-Detection; Rule based; Network security",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123702586

Secure cryptography created a niche for blockchain to provide alternatives to well-known security compromises. However, design bottlenecks with traditional blockchain data structures scale poorly with increased network usage and are extremely computation-intensive. This made the technology difficult to combine with limited devices, like those in Internet of Things networks. In protocols like IOTA, replacement of blockchain's linked-list queue processing with a lightweight dynamic ledger showed remarkable throughput performance increase. However, current stochastic algorithms for ledger construction suffer distinct trade-offs between efficiency and security. This work proposed a machine-learning approach with a multi-arm bandit that resolved these issues and was designed for auditing on limited devices. This algorithm was tested in a reinforcement-learning environment simulating the IOTA ledger's construction with a decision tree. This study showed through regret analysis and experimentation that this approach was secure against impulse manipulation attacks while remaining energy-efficient.

These vulnerabilities should ideally be found and fixed before the code gets deployed. Machine learning-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance in capturing vulnerabilities. These methods are predominantly supervised. Their prediction models are trained on a set of ground truth data where the training data and test data are assumed to be drawn from the same probability distribution. However, in practice, the test data often differs from the training data in terms of distribution because they are from different projects or they differ in the types of vulnerability. In this article, we present a new system for Cross Domain Software Vulnerability Discovery (CD-VulD) using deep learning (DL) and domain adaptation (DA). We employ DL because it has the capacity of automatically constructing high-level abstract feature representations of programs, which are likely of more cross-domain useful than the handcrafted features driven by domain knowledge. The divergence between distributions is reduced by learning cross-domain representations. First, given software program representations, CD-VulD converts them into token sequences and learns the token embeddings for generalization across tokens. Next, CD-VulD employs a deep feature model to build abstract high-level presentations based on those sequences. Then, the metric transfer learning framework (MTLF) technique is employed to learn cross-domain representations by minimizing the distribution divergence between the source domain and the target domain. Finally, the cross-domain representations are used to build a classifier for vulnerability detection. Experimental results show that CD-VulD outperforms the state-of-the-art vulnerability detection approaches by a wide margin. We make the new datasets publicly available so that our work is replicable and can be further improved. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Cross-domain; deep learning; domain adaptation; machine learning; vulnerability detection/discovery","Abstracting; Deep learning; Domain Knowledge; Network security; Cross-domain; Deep learning; Domain adaptation; Domain representations; Software vulnerabilities; Test data; Training data; Vulnerability detection; Vulnerability detection/discovery; Vulnerability discovery; Probability distributions",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123676423

Flow-monitoring, typically based on the Internet Protocol Flow Information Export (IPFIX) standard, now goes well beyond collecting statistical information about network connections. Current solutions are even able to include selected parts of the payload in these Flows to be used in conjunction with NIDS. Recently, we extended this concept to application layer HTTP Flows.

In this article, we address the issue of demand response of EVs during MG outages by leveraging Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. Particularly, we investigate an auction trading market that allows EVs with surplus energy to act as sellers, and EVs that want to be charged to act as buyers. A novel distributed double auction scheme is proposed to allow each buyer EV to submit multiple bids to seller EVs in different parking lots. Nonetheless, the locations of buyer EVs could be inferred by an adversary through analyzing the valuations, posing serious privacy and security risks. In this regard, a valuation-based attack scheme is investigated to validate the potential privacy risk. To defend against such an attack, we present a location privacy-preserving double auction scheme, in which the MicroGrid Central Controller (MGCC) acts as the auctioneer, solving the social welfare maximization problem of matching buyers to sellers, and the cloud is used to conduct calculations for the auctioneer, protecting the privacy of participants via homomorphic encryption. Theoretical analysis is conducted to validate our auction scheme in satisfying the designed economic and privacy properties (e.g., strategy-proofness and $k$k-anonymity).

This is because protocol designers are confronted with a long-standing 'security versus efficiency' dilemma: sensor nodes are lightweight devices with limited storage and computation capabilities, while the security requirements are demanding as WSNs are generally deployed for sensitive applications. Hundreds of proposals have been proposed, yet most of them have been found to be problematic, and the same mistakes are repeated again and again. Two of the most common security failures are regarding smart card loss attacks and node capture attacks. The former has been extensively investigated in the literature, while little attention has been given to understanding the node capture attacks. To alleviate this undesirable situation, this article takes a substantial step towards systematically exploring node capture attacks against multi-factor user authentication schemes for WSNs. We first investigate the various causes and consequences of node capture attacks, and classify them into ten different types in terms of the attack targets, adversary's capabilities and vulnerabilities exploited. Then, we elaborate on each type of attack through examining 11 typical vulnerable protocols, and suggest corresponding countermeasures. Finally, we conduct a large-scale comparative measurement of 61 representative user authentication schemes for WSNs under our extended evaluation criteria.

However, most of the existing mobile crowdsensing models are based on centralized platforms, which have some problems in reality. Data storage is overly dependent on third-party platforms leading to single-point failures. Besides, trust issues seriously affect users' willingness to participate and the credibility of data. To solve these two problems, a creditable and distributed incentive mechanism based on Hyperledger Fabric (HF-CDIM) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the HF-CDIM combines auction, reputation and data detection methods. First, we develop a multi-attribute auction algorithm with a reputation on blockchain by designing a smart contract, which achieves a distributed incentive mechanism for participants. Second, we propose a K-nearest neighbor outlier detection algorithm based on geographic location and similarity to quantify the credibility of the data. It is also used to update the user's reputation index. This guarantees the credibility of sensing data. Finally, the simulation results using real-world data set verify the effectiveness and feasibility of above mechanism. © 2022 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is one of the most important IoT applications. IoT supports AMI to collect data from smart sensors, analyse and measure abnormalities in the energy consumption pattern of sensors. However, two-way communication in distributed sensors is sensitive and tends towards security and privacy issues. Before deploying distributed sensors, data confidentiality and privacy and message authentication for sensor devices and control messages are the major security requirements. Several authentications and encryption protocols have been developed to provide confidentiality and integrity. However, many sensors in distributed systems, resource constraint smart sensors, and adaptability of IoT communication protocols in sensors necessitate designing an efficient and lightweight security authentication scheme. This paper proposes a Payload Encryption-based Optimisation Scheme for lightweight authentication (PEOS) on distributed sensors. The PEOS integrates and optimises important features of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) in Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) architecture instead of implementing the DTLS in a separate channel. The proposed work designs a payload encryption scheme and an Optimised Advanced Encryption Standard (OP-AES). The PEOS modifies the DTLS handshaking and retransmission processes in PEOS using payload encryption and NACK messages, respectively. It also removes the duplicate features of the protocol version and sequence number without impacting the performance of CoAP. Moreover, the PEOS attempts to improve the CoAP over distributed sensors in the aspect of optimised AES operations, such as parallel execution of S-boxes in SubBytes and delayed Mixcolumns. The efficiency of PEOS authentication is evaluated on Conitki OS using the Cooja simulator for lightweight security and authentication. The proposed scheme attains better throughput while minimising the message size overhead by 9% and 23% than the existing payload-based mutual authentication PbMA and basic DTLS/CoAP scheme in random network topologies with less than 50 nodes. © 2022 by the authors.

The Scaled Gradient Descent algorithm and the Adam optimization are studied with better classification results, obtained by the developed classifiers, using the latter. Tangent hyperbolic function appears to be proper selection for the hidden neurons. Two sets of features, gathered from aggregated records of the network traffic, are tested, containing 8 and 10 components.

Recently PLCs are often utilized in a modernized power grid system for implementing an additional layer of automated control, such as operation of circuit breakers under specific conditions. Thus, in order to create a software-based smart grid testbed (or ‘cyber range' for cyber security experiments); emulation of the PLC is imperative. OpenPLC is a software widely used for emulating PLCs, but unfortunately it does not support IEC 61850 standard, which is the globally adopted standard for substation automation in smart power grid systems. Thus, in this paper, the enhancement of OpenPLC to support IEC 61850 protocol and information models is discussed.

To deal with the increased software complexity, many of these systems have adopted reliable RTOSes (Real-Time Operating Systems) with advanced protection functionalities. Meanwhile, the concept of IoT (Internet of Things) is gaining momentum. Many IoT OSes, specialized to provide the large software stack required by IoT applications, have been released. Nevertheless, neither reliable RTOS nor IoT OS can satisfy all the requirements of IoT-enabled reliable systems. Dual-OS configuration (i.e. the coexistence of reliable RTOS and IoT OS) is a promising approach to achieve high reliability and productivity simultaneously. Existing dual-OS solutions, however, depend on additional hardware features (e.g. virtualization extensions, ARM TrustZone), which are unavailable in most resource-constrained devices. This paper presents iSotEE (iSolated Execution Environment), a middleware allowing IoT OS to run inside an isolated environment on top of a reliable RTOS without special hardware. Open-source implementations of iSotEE for Renesas RX (with TOPPERS/HRP3 as reliable RTOS, Amazon FreeRTOS as IoT OS) and ARMv7-M (with two configurations of Zephyr as reliable RTOS and IoT OS) architectures are provided and evaluated.

Since detected objects under surveillance are usually low-resolution and noisy, their accurate recognition represents a huge challenge. Knowledge distillation is an effective method to deal with it, but existing related work usually focuses on reducing the channel count of a student network, not feature map size. As a result, they cannot transfer -privilege information hidden in feature maps of a wide and deep teacher network into a thin and shallow student one, leading to the latter's poor performance. To address this issue, we propose a Feature Map Distillation (FMD) framework under which the feature map size of teacher and student networks is different. FMD consists of two main components: Feature Decoder Distillation (FDD) and Feature Map Consistency-enforcement (FMC). FDD reconstructs the shallow texture features of a thin student network to approximate the corresponding samples in a teacher network, which allows the high-resolution ones to directly guide the learning of the shallow features of the student network. FMC makes the size and direction of each deep feature map consistent between student and teacher networks, which constrains each pair of feature maps to produce the same feature distribution. FDD and FMC allow a thin student network to learn rich -privilege information in feature maps of a wide teacher network. The overall performance of FMD is verified in multiple recognition tasks by comparing it with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods on low-resolution and noisy objects. 1941-0042 © 2022 IEEE.

Based on the actual demand of defending against the APT threat, we apply natural language processing to process the cyberspace threat intelligence (CTI) and design a new automation system CTI View, which is oriented to text extraction and analysis for the massive unstructured cyberspace threat intelligence (CTI) released by various security vendors. The main work of CTI View is as follows: (1) to deal with heterogeneous CTI, a text extraction framework for threat intelligence is designed based on automated test framework, text recognition technology, and text denoising technology. It effectively solves the problem of poor adaptability when crawlers are used to crawl heterogeneous CTI; (2) using regular expressions combined with blacklist and whitelist mechanism to extract the IOC and TTP information described in CTI effectively; (3) according to the actual requirements, a model based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is designed to complete the entity extraction algorithm for heterogeneous threat intelligence. In this paper, the GRU layer is added to the existing BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model, and we evaluate the proposed model on the marked dataset and get better performance than the current mainstream entity extraction mode. © 2022 Yinghai Zhou et al.",,"Automation; Character recognition; Cybersecurity; Extraction; Network security; Active countermeasures; Active defense; Analysis system; Cyber threats; Cyberspaces; Entity extractions; Intelligence analysis; Networks security; Strategic defence; Text extraction; Natural language processing systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123251568

Recently, certificate-based authentication schemes have been extensively studied. However, many of these schemes are not efficient in computation, storage, and communication, which are highly required in IoT. In this paper, we propose a lightweight authentication scheme based on consortium blockchain and design a cryptocurrency-like digital token to build trust.

The goal was to investigate the awareness among insiders about some facets of cybersecurity concerning human–robot interactions. We designed an electronic questionnaire and submitted it to a relevant sample of physiotherapists. The questionnaire allowed us to collect data related to: (i) use of robots and its relationship with cybersecurity in the context of physiotherapy; (ii) training in cybersecurity and robotics for the insiders; (iii) insiders’ self-assessment on cybersecurity and robotics in some usage scenarios, and (iv) their experiences of cyber-attacks in this area and proposals for improve-ment.

However, as the IoT devices within the same coverage of the BS can offload lots of tasks simultaneously, the FN can be overloaded, resulting in scalability issues due to limited computing resources. As a promising solution to this problem, opportunistic FNs (OFNs) which denote FNs with mobility such as smart phones and vehicles have been considered as they opportunistically reduce the load of static FNs. IoT devices can offload a task and receive the result to/from the OFN directly when OFN is close to the device. In addition, the offloading can be conducted indirectly through the BS when the OFN is not in the vicinity of the IoT devices while it is within the coverage of the BS. To assess the offloading performance according to the mobility of the OFN considering the direct and indirect offloading scenarios, we developed an analytic model for the opportunistic offloading probability that the task can be offloaded to the OFN, which can also be interpreted as the load distribution effect.

The focus of this study is on the relevant issue of the safe use of LiDAR data and measurement systems within the “smart city” infrastructure. The research team analyzed and systematized various external impacts on the LiDAR systems, as well as the state-of-the-art approaches to improving their security and resilience. It has been established that the current works on the analysis of external influences on the LiDARs and methods for their mitigation focus mainly on physical (hardware) approaches (proposing most often other types of modulation and optical signal frequencies), and less often software approaches, through the use of additional anomaly detection techniques and data integrity verification systems, as well as improving the efficiency of data filtering in the cloud point. In addition, the sources analyzed in this paper do not offer methodological support for the design of the LiDAR in the very early stages of their creation, taking into account a priori assessment of the allowed SNR threshold and probability of detecting a reflected pulse and the requirements to minimize the probability of “missing” an object when scanning with no a priori assessments of the detection probability characteristics of the LiDAR. The authors propose a synthetic approach as a mathematical tool for designing a resilient LiDAR system. The approach is based on the physics of infrared radiation, the Bayesian theory, and the Neyman–Pearson criterion. It features the use of a predetermined threshold for false alarms, the probability of interference in the analytics, and the characteristics of the LiDAR’s receivers. The result is the analytical solution to the problem of calculating the allowed SNR while stabilizing the level of “false alarms” in terms of background noise caused by a given type of interference. The work presents modelling results for the “false alarm” probability values depending on the selected optimality criterion. The efficiency of the proposed approach has been proven by the simulation results of the received optical power of the LiDAR’s signal based on the calculated SNR threshold and noise values. © 2022 by the authors.

Further, it aids sensor networks, real-time streaming apps, and the IoT, all of which require high-speed and dependable internet access. For such an IoT system, Resource Scheduling Process (RSP) seems to be one of the most important tasks. This paper presents a RSP for Edge Computing (EC).

The results demonstrate that this technique enhances resource scheduling efficiency in EC and Quality of Service (QoS). The experimental study revealed that the suggested FCERS method in this work converges quicker than the other methods. Our method reduces the total computing cost, execution time, and energy consumption on average compared to the baseline. The ES allocates higher processing resources to each user in case of limited availability of MDs; this results in improved task execution time and a reduced total task computation cost.

In this league, it is crucial to determine those characteristics in the systems that can help in the accurate assessment of the sustainable-security of the health information software during the development stage. This research work employed the Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (Fuzzy ANP) to estimate the impact of the overall sustainable-security of health information software systems and their characteristics in order to achieve a high level of sustainable-security. Furthermore, the study validates the efficacy of the Fuzzy ANP procedure by testing it on five different versions of a health information software system through Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (Fuzzy TOPSIS).

To safeguard an organization’s cyberenvironments, information, and communication technologies, many enterprises are investing substantially in cybersecurity these days. One part of the cyberdefense mechanism is building an enterprises’ security policies library, for consistent implementation of security controls. Significant and common cybersecurity policies of various enterprises are compared and explored in this study to provide robust and comprehensive cybersecurity knowledge that can be used in various enterprises. Several significant common security policies were identified and discussed in this comprehensive study. This study identified 10 common cybersecurity policy aspects in five enterprises: healthcare, finance, education, aviation, and e-commerce. We aimed to build a strong infrastructure in each business, and investigate the security laws and policies that apply to all businesses in each sector. Furthermore, the findings of this study reveal that the importance of cybersecurity requirements differ across multiple organizations. The choice and applicability of cybersecurity policies are determined by the type of information under control and the security requirements of organizations in relation to these policies. © 2022 by the authors.

Hence, network separation technology has been designed to stop the leakage of information by separating business computing networks from the Internet. However, security accidents have been continuously occurring, owing to the degradation of data transmission latency performance between the networks, decreasing the convenience and usability of the work environment. In a conventional centralized network connection concept, a problem occurs because if either usability or security is strengthened, the other is weakened. In this study, we proposed a distributed authentication mechanism for secure network connectivity (DAM4SNC) technology in a distributed network environment that requires security and latency performance simultaneously to overcome the trade‐off limitations of existing technology. By communicating with separated networks based on the authentication between distributed nodes, the inefficiency of conventional centralized network connection solutions is overcome. Moreover, the security is enhanced through periodic authentication of the distributed nodes and differentiation of the certification levels. As a result of the experiment, the relative efficiency of the proposed scheme (REP) was about 420% or more in all cases. © 2022 by the authors.

However, due to the resource-constrained nature, lack of physical protection and security requirements of the inherent protocol, LLNs are vulnerable to attacks that primarily alter the working of the RPL protocol and disrupt the ongoing communication. Therefore, it is a high profit and desperate target of many attackers. Our work offers a detailed overview of one such significant threat to RPL known as the rank attack. Considering the resource-constrained nature of the IoT devices, we propose and evaluate a lightweight and efficient method to mitigate and isolate the rank attack. Specifically, our approach uses a novel Echelon Metric Based Objective Function (EMBOF) over the default RPL to calculate and check the legitimacy of the advertised rank. The Echelon value is additively determined by the root node and the corresponding parent node(s) in the RPL network topology. Our approach not only detects the attacker node(s) but also isolates it immediately. We implement and evaluate our approach through extensive simulations in Cooja, a Contiki operating system (OS) based simulator.

A possible attack is the model inversion attack (MIA) which aims to reveal the identity of a targeted user by generating the most proper datapoint input to the system with maximum corresponding confidence score at the output. The generated data of a registered user can be maliciously used as a serious invasion of the user privacy. In literature, MIA processes are categorized into white-box and black-box scenarios which are respectively with and without information about the system structure, parameters, and partially about the users. This research work assumes the MIA under semi-white box scenario of availability of system model structure and parameters but not any user data information, and verifies it as a severe threat even for a deep-learning-based face recognition system despite its complex structure and the diversity of registered user data. The alert state is promoted by Deep MIA which is the integration of deep generative models in MIA, and α -GAN integrated MIA-initilized by a face based seed ( α -GAN-MIA-FS) is proposed. As a novel MIA search strategy, a pre-trained deep generative model with capability of generating a face image from a random feature vector is used for narrowing down the image search space to the feature vectors space, which has much lower dimensions. This allows the MIA process to efficiently search for a low-dimensional feature vector whose corresponding face image maximizes the confidence score. We have experimentally evaluated the proposed method by two objective criteria and three subjective criteria in comparison to α -GAN-integrated MIA initialized with a random seed ( α -GAN-MIA-RS), DCGAN-integrated MIA (DCGAN-MIA), and the conventional MIA. The evaluation results approve the efficiency and superiority of the proposed technique in generating natural looking face clones with high recognizability as the targeted users. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","cybersecurity; deep generative model; deep learning; face recognition system; Media clone; model inversion attack","Clone cells; Cloning; Cybersecurity; Data privacy; Deep neural networks; Search engines; Vector spaces; Convolutional neural network; Cyber security; Deep generative model; Deep learning; Face recognition systems; Generative model; Medium clone; Model inversion; Model inversion attack; Privacy; Target recognition; Face recognition",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122590975

However, these devices possess various security flaws resulting from the lack of defense mechanisms and hardware security support, therefore making them vulnerable to cyber attacks. In addition, IoT gateways provide very limited security features to detect such threats, especially the absence of intrusion detection methods powered by deep learning. Indeed, deep learning models require high computational power that exceeds the capacity of these gateways. In this paper, we introduce Realguard, an DNN-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) directly operated on local gateways to protect IoT devices within the network. The superiority of our proposal is that it can accurately detect multiple cyber attacks in real time with a small computational footprint. This is achieved by a lightweight feature extraction mechanism and an efficient attack detection model powered by deep neural networks. Our evaluations on practical datasets indicate that Realguard could detect ten types of attacks (e.g., port scan, Botnet, and FTP-Patator) in real time with an average accuracy of 99.57%, whereas the best of our competitors is 98.85%.

Over the last century, the Internet of Things (IoT) has expanded quickly, with more than 25 million linked gadgets anticipated by 2020. In the future, the amount of information generated from these gadgets will grow by a factor of ten. Out of this, IoT sensors generate a huge quantity of information in a variety of various formats with variable reliability characterized by its speed in terms of temporal and location dependence. For example, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms may play a key role in guaranteeing safety and permission based on biomedicine, as well as anomaly recognition to enhance the accessibility and security of Internet of Things systems. As an alternative, hackers use learning techniques to exploited weaknesses in intelligent IoT devices. As a result of this, we suggest in this article that the safety of IoT devices may be improved by identifying spam using ML techniques. Spam Identification in IoT utilizing ML Framework is suggested to accomplish this goal. A huge collection of input features sets is used to test five ML models. Each algorithm calculates a spam score based on the input characteristics that have been further improved. According to numerous criteria, this score represents the dependability of IoT devices. To validate the suggested method, the Retrofit Connected Home datasets is utilised. As a consequence of these findings, the suggested system is more effective than the other current methods. © Kalahari Journals.","Internet of Things; Machine Learning; Spam Detection",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122368119

The rapid development of local computing devices and container-based virtualization enabled the application of fog computing within the IoT environment. However, it is necessary to utilize algorithm-based service scheduling that considers the targeted QoS parameters to optimize the service performance and reach the potential of the fog computing concept. In this paper, we first describe our categorization of IoT services that affects the execution of our scheduling algorithm. Secondly, we propose our scheduling algorithm that considers the context of processing devices, user context, and service context to determine the optimal schedule for the execution of service components across the distributed fog-to-cloud environment. The conducted simulations confirmed the performance of the proposed algorithm and showcased its major contribution—dynamic scheduling, i.e., the responsiveness to the volatile QoS parameters due to changeable network conditions. Thus, we successfully demonstrated that our dynamic scheduling algorithm enhances the efficiency of service performance based on the targeted QoS criteria of the specific service scenario. © 2022 by the authors.

A fundamental element of the cloud-native approach is a microservice-an instance, which is usually virtualised, serving for only a defined purpose. Virtualised microservices are mostly used in cloud-based IoT systems, which can be covered with multi-agent system (MAS) paradigm. The maintenance of a MAS requires a constant monitoring to track the system state and to satisfy the service level agreement (SLA) (or any other) requirements. This paper presents a resource efficient reliability model for MAS IoT systems for monitoring purposes. First, we provide a thorough mathematical analysis to describe the generic system model and its elements. This model takes into account SLA requirements and it is characterised with linear time complexity, simplicity of computations and input metrics (e.g., combination of SLA for CPU and its workload), where all of the input data are aligned to the same range. Then, we evaluate time complexity and provide a measurement to demonstrate the reliability of the model application. The results show that the proposed model is efficient for large number of the IoT agents. It is approximately 98 times faster in computation with 1,000 systems when compared with [D.

This paper recommends a novel hybrid encryption/decryption scheme that can be applied in e-healthcare, or IoHS, for the protection of medical images. The proposed system explores innovative perturbation algorithms that utilize novel chaotic maps. The proposed perturbation-based data encryption is employed in both rounds of confusion and diffusion to cope the drawbacks of traditional chaos-based confusion and diffusion architectures. Particularly, (i) the new maps parameters and chaotic sequences are used to control the permutation and diffusion properties of the scheme, and (2) the derived properties control pixel shuffling and operations of substitution. Different techniques and tests are used to analyzed the chaotic behaviors of the proposed system, including the bifurcation diagram, Lyapunov exponents, as well as the NIST and DIEHARD tests.

In-situ process authentication may assure that the AM part is fabricated as intended. Most cyber-physical attacks towards AM processes can be manifested as printing path alterations, and an in-situ optical imaging system can detect alteration in the printing path. This will prevent catastrophic geometric changes and mechanical property compromises in the AM parts, ultimately improving the AM process security. In this paper, a novel process authentication methodology is proposed based on image texture analysis of the layer-wise in-situ videos. The layer-wise distribution of the segmented textures’ geometric features is characterized as the layer-wise texture descriptor tensor (LTDT). Given the high dimensionality and sparsity of the extracted LTDTs, the multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) algorithm is used for dimension reduction. Subsequently, the Hotelling T2 control charting technique is adopted for alteration detection based on the extracted low-dimensional layer-wise features. Case studies based on a fused filament fabrication (FFF) process were conducted to evaluate and validate the proposed framework. The proposed method can achieve over 95% of accuracy, which illustrates that the proposed method can accurately detect process alterations due to printing path changes.

In the present study, this approach is extended to model the functional behaviour of electronic hardware by a neural network (NN) with Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) layers to encapsulate potential time-dependence of the signals. The proposed method is illustrated and validated on measurements from a remote-controlled drone, which is operated with two variants of controller hardware: a reference controller unit and a malfunctioning counterpart.

In addition, the lightweight nature of our solution is suitable for deployment on heterogeneous and resource constrained IoT devices. Besides, we leverage geometric secret sharing for establishing mutual authentication among the participating entities. We validate the security of the proposed protocol using the AVISPA formal verification tool and prototype it on a Raspberry Pi to analyze the power consumption. Finally, a comparison with existing schemes reveals that our scheme incurs a 20% reduction in communication overhead on smart devices.

Considering the massive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) products, the challenge of software development while addressing the security and safety concerns of these devices will continue to increase. This paper presents a comprehensive and detailed review of agile software development in the context of IoT, ITS, and their cybersecurity and risk challenges. Furthermore, we provide a systematic comparison of the reviewed literature based on a set of defined criteria. Finally, we provide a broader outlook and an outline for designing future security-enhanced agile software development solutions for IoT and ITS systems.

These services are realized through control and monitoring applications that are typically developed using artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) based algorithms, that play a significant role to highlight the efficiency of traditional healthcare systems. Current personalized healthcare services are dedicated in a specific environment to support technological personalization (e.g., personalized gadgets/devices). However, they are unable to consider different inter-related health conditions, leading to inappropriate diagnosis and affect sustainability and the long-term health/life of patients. Towards this problem, the state-of-the-art Healthcare 5.0 technology has evolved that supersede previous healthcare technologies. The goal of healthcare 5.0 is to achieve a fully autonomous healthcare service, that takes into account the interdependent effect of different health conditions of a patient. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on personalized healthcare services. In particular, we first present an overview of key requirements of comprehensive personalized healthcare services (CPHS) in modern healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT), including the definition of personalization and an example use case scenario as a representative for modern HIoT. Second, we explored a fundamental three-layer architecture for IoT-based healthcare systems using both AI and non-AI-based approaches, considering key requirements for CPHS followed by their strengths and weaknesses in the frame of personalized healthcare services. Third, we highlighted different security threats against each layer of IoT architecture along with the possible AI and non-AI-based solutions. Finally, we propose a methodology to develop reliable, resilient, and personalized healthcare services that address the identified weaknesses of existing approaches. © 2013 IEEE.","Healthcare 5.0; IoT; medicine 4.0; personalization; reliability; resilience; sustainability","5G mobile communication systems; Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Health care; Software reliability; Surveys; Sustainable development; Biomedical monitoring; Healthcare 5.0; Healthcare services; License; Medical services; Medicine 4.0; Personalizations; Resilience; Software-Reliability; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122084452

In a nutshell, IoT is the integration of devices and data such that processes are automated and centralized to a certain extent. IoT is revolutionizing the way business is done and is transforming society as a whole. As this technology advances further, the need to exploit detection and weakness awareness increases to prevent unauthorized access to critical resources and business functions, thereby rendering the system unavailable. Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS attacks are all too common. In this paper, we propose a Protocol Based Deep Intrusion Detection (PB-DID) architecture, in which we created a data-set of packets from IoT traffic by comparing features from the UNSWNB15 and Bot-IoT data-sets based on flow and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). We classify non-anomalous, DoS, and DDoS traffic uniquely by taking care of the problems like imbalanced and over-fitting.

The unmonitored control and the extensive use of fossil fuel in water-table pumping for irrigation exacerbate global warming and harm the environment. Along with the rapid population growth and the concomitant increase in the demand for food, optimal usage of water-table and energy is becoming a must and indispensable for sustainable agriculture. In this context, Smart Agriculture (SA) is emerging as a promising field that leverages ICT (Information and Communication Technology) to optimize resources' usage while enhancing crops' yields. In this paper, we present an integral SA solution that leverages cost-effectiveness. Commercial solutions are costly and thus become impossible to adopt by small and medium farmers. Our solution revolves around three main axes: 1. Smart Water Metering promotes optimal usage and conservation of water-table (a.k.a., groundwater) via real-time data collection and monitoring using a Cloud-based IoT (Internet of Things) system; 2. Renewable-Energy integration promotes energy-efficient agriculture by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in water-table pumping, and 3. Smart Irrigation to promote good crops quality and quantity without harming the soil and the water-table ecosystems. Our solution has been deployed and tested in a real-world Smart Farm testbed. The results have shown that the adoption of our SA system reduces the amount of water consumption (with a traditional irrigation system) up to 71.8%. Finally, our solution is open-source and can be easily adopted and adapted by other researchers to promote the setting of a dedicated Cloud-based platform for water-table usage, especially in arid and sub-Saharan countries. © 2013 IEEE.","fuzzy logic control; information communication technology (ICT); Internet of Things (IoT); Smart agriculture (SA); wireless sensors networks (WSN)","Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Fuzzy logic; Global warming; Groundwater; Interactive computer systems; Internet of things; Irrigation; Population statistics; Real time systems; Water management; Fuzzy logic control; Information communication technology; Internet of thing; Real - Time system; Renewable energy source; Smart agriculture; Smart agricultures; Wireless communications; Wireless sensor network; Wireless sensor networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122063171

Network communication has improved, helping the vehicles transition from completely machine-to software-controlled technologies. The autonomous vehicle network is controlled by the controller area network (CAN) bus protocol. Nevertheless, the autonomous vehicle network still has issues and weaknesses concerning cybersecurity due to the complexity of data and traffic behaviors that benefit the unauthorized intrusion to a CAN bus and several types of attacks. Therefore, developing systems to rapidly detect message attacks in CAN is one of the biggest challenges. This study pre-sents a high-performance system with an artificial intelligence approach that protects the vehicle network from cyber threats. The system secures the autonomous vehicle from intrusions by using deep learning approaches. The proposed security system was verified by using a real automatic vehicle network dataset, including spoofing, flood, replaying attacks, and benign packets. Prepro-cessing was applied to convert the categorical data into numerical. This dataset was processed by using the convolution neural network (CNN) and a hybrid network combining CNN and long short-term memory (CNN–LSTM) models to identify attack messages. The results revealed that the model achieved high performance, as evaluated by the metrics of precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The proposed system achieved high accuracy (97.30%). Along with the empirical demon-stration, the proposed system enhanced the detection and classification accuracy compared with the existing systems and was proven to have superior performance for real-time CAN bus security. © 2022 by the authors.

The Ubiquitous use of tiny devices and embedded sensor frameworks has pushed IoT to the forefront of emerging technologies used in many applications like peer-to-peer networks, smart energy grids, home and building automation, vehicle to vehicle communication, and wearable computing devices. This massive growth and extensive use brought forth security risks that could hinder its commencement in many novel applications. The number of interconnected devices leads the way to several entry points for intruders and, along with it, security risks. The sensitive nature of the IoT applications such as health, automation, and energy grids cannot afford security risks. Traditional security mechanisms will not design or develop to secure such an emerging technology as IoT. Existing technologies have to be relied on with the non-existence of security mechanisms for this purpose. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is one such technology that can reduce the security risks in IoT. The central node vulnerability that can compromise the whole system can be mitigated by eliminating the need for a central node by using the distributed ledger. Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, has attracted tremendous attention and harnessed in itself a real-world value. However, computationally costly with limited scalability is not entirely suited for the IoT environment. IoT Application (IOTA) technology is the distributed ledger technology that can provide unlimited scalability specifically suitable for the IoT industry. This survey provides an in-depth introduction to how blockchain performs and its constraints in its nature as a generic platform for DLT.

Based on their multiple-year experience and expended competences, the operators may provide digital services for entities responsible for the energy security infrastructure. Verification of this goal is necessary, since critical infrastructure is exposed to growing threats, both in the area of energy and other sensitive sectors of the economy. Research results presented in the article were obtained by conducting a CATI survey. The study used the purposeful selection method, which allows to influence the structure of a sample in the context of goals set by the authors.

Industry equipment is handled by systems connected to the internet, either via wireless or cable connectivity, in the present digital age.

The core concept of smart society emphasizes utilizing information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure to improve every aspect of life. Among the variety of smart services, eHealth is at the forefront of these promises. eHealth is rapidly gaining popularity to overcome the insufficient healthcare services and provide patient-centric treatment for the rising aging population with chronic diseases. Keeping in view the sensitivity of medical data, this interfacing between healthcare and technology has raised many security concerns. Among the many contemporary solutions, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is the dominant technology because of its inherent support for one-to-many transfer and fine-grained access control mechanisms to confidential medical data. ABE uses costly bilinear pairing operations, which are too heavy for eHealth’s tiny wireless body area network (WBAN) devices despite its proper functionality. We present an efficient and secure ABE architecture with outsourcing intense encryption and decryption operations in this work. For practical realization, our scheme uses elliptic curve scalar point multiplication as the underlying technology of ABE instead of costly pairing operations. In addition, it provides support for attribute/users revocation and verifiability of outsourced medical data. Using the selective-set security model, the proposed scheme is secure under the elliptic curve decisional Diffie–Hellman (ECDDH) assumption. The performance assessment and top-ranked value via the help of fuzzy logic’s evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method show that the proposed scheme is efficient and suitable for access control in eHealth smart societies. © 2022 by the authors.

This article models a cloud service undergoing the co-residence data theft attacks. The threshold-voting-based {N} -version programming (NVP) is implemented to improve the service reliability, where multiple service component versions (SCVs) are activated in parallel to perform the requested service. The final output is determined upon receiving a threshold number of identical outputs from the SCVs, immediately followed by canceling all outstanding SCVs to reduce expenses. Probabilistic models are first introduced to evaluate performance metrics of the considered service, including the data theft probability, service success probability, expected service operation time, and expected utility. Optimization problems are further solved to find the optimal number of SCVs maximizing the expected utility. Interactions among different model parameters and VM allocation policies, as well as their effects on the considered performance metrics and on the optimization solutions are studied through examples. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud computing; data security; N-version programming (NVP); threshold voting; virtual machine (VM)","Cloud data security; Cost effectiveness; Crime; Distributed database systems; Network security; Side channel attack; Virtual machine; Cloud services; Cloud-computing; Data thefts; N version programming; N-version programming; Performance metrices; Service components; Theft attack; Threshold voting; Virtual machine; Cloud computing",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121842926

To overcome this challenge, we propose an approach for automated behaviour-based clustering of IoT botnet samples, aimed to enable automatic identification of IoT botnet variants equipped with new capabilities. In the proposed approach, the behaviour of the IoT botnet samples is captured using a sandbox and represented as behaviour profiles describing the actions performed by the samples. The behaviour profiles are vectorised using TF-IDF and clustered using the DBSCAN algorithm. The proposed approach was evaluated using a collection of samples captured from IoT botnets propagating on the Internet.

The voluminous increase in spam has necessitated developing more reliable and vigorous artificial intelligence-based anti-spam filters. Besides text, an email sometimes contains multimedia content such as audio, video, and images. However, text-centric email spam filtering employing text classification techniques remains today’s preferred choice. In this paper, we show that text pre-processing techniques nullify the detection of malicious contents in an obscure communication framework. We use Spamassassin corpus with and without text pre-processing and examined it using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to classify these as ham or spam emails. The proposed DL-based approach consistently outperforms ML models. In the first stage, using pre-processing techniques, the long-short-term memory (LSTM) model achieves the highest results of 93.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and 95% F1-score. In the second stage, without using pre-processing techniques, LSTM achieves the best results of 95.26% precision, 97.18% recall, and 96% F1-score. Results show the supremacy of DL algorithms over the standard ones in filtering spam.

Therefore, the quality of food and food products concerns not only all the end consumers but also millions of employees and entrepreneurs within the global food industry. Achieving the best possible quality of food throughout all the engaged processes requires constantly tracing and monitoring several crucial environmental conditions that may have a significant impact on the products' quality. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a system of dedicated sensors paired with the Internet that can overcome and prevent issues within the food industry. The interconnected elements bear the responsibility for monitoring, evaluating, and tracking the conditions where the food products undergo processing, and it checks the products' quality throughout their life cycle. Nevertheless, even IIoT has its challenges. The first such challenge relates to the storage and accessibility of the obtained data. What can make the data readily available to all individuals and entities involved in the industry? The second significant challenge relates to tracing items that pass through numerous processes involving different parties. This work proposed ProChain, a Provenance-aware Traceability Framework for IoT-based Supply Chain Systems. A proposed comprehensive framework of all the information acquired by the sensors and the complete set of provenance data addressed these challenges. Additionally, a thorough simulation of the proposed framework on the Raspberry PI 3B IoT device reviewed the ProChain efficiency in the cloud and local simulation environments. ProChain demonstrated tractability, transparency, and complex security as examples of the principal attributes of the IOTA 2.0 protocol in the food industry. © 2013 IEEE.","Internet of Things; IoT; Provenance; Supply chain management; Traceability","Blockchain; Digital storage; Food products; Internet of things; Life cycle; Block-chain; Current values; End consumers; Environmental conditions; Food industries; Food system; Global economies; Provenance; Supply chain systems; Traceability; Supply chain management",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121804276

Lightweight, multipurpose, and anomaly‐based detection NIDSs employ sev-eral methods to build profiles for normal and malicious behaviors. In this paper, we design, imple-ment, and evaluate the performance of machine‐learning‐based NIDS in IoT networks. Specifically, we study six supervised learning methods that belong to three different classes: (1) ensemble meth-ods, (2) neural network methods, and (3) kernel methods. To evaluate the developed NIDSs, we use the distilled‐Kitsune‐2018 and NSL‐KDD datasets, both consisting of a contemporary real‐world IoT network traffic subjected to different network attacks. Standard performance evaluation metrics from the machine‐learning literature are used to evaluate the identification accuracy, error rates, and inference speed. Our empirical analysis indicates that ensemble methods provide better accuracy and lower error rates compared with neural network and kernel methods. On the other hand, neural network methods provide the highest inference speed which proves their suitability for high-bandwidth networks.

Successful cyber attacks on nation-states have proved that cyber threats can jeopardize significant national interests. In response, nation-states have begun to handle cyber threats at the national defense level, which is titled ‘cyber defense.’ The cyber defense sector is related to national security, therefore requires robust security technology. Contrary to normal systems, blockchain provides strong security properties without a centralized control entity, and as such its application in the cyber defense field is under the spotlight. In this paper, we present opportunities blockchain provides for cyber defense, research and national projects, and limitations. We constructed a survey of government documents, interviews, related news, technical reports, and research papers from 2016 to 2021. As a result, our research contributes to reducing the gap in blockchain for cyber defense by systematically conducting research and analysis. In our research, we found that not only research but also government-led plans are actively promoting blockchain, which demonstrates that blockchain will play a remarkable role in cyber defense.

In this paper, we detail the model of CPPS and its coupling mechanism in operation and discuss the propagation mechanism of cascading failure within and across a physical power grid and a commu-nication network.

THECB selects next-hop nodes according to 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors’ information. In addition, the greedy forwarding mechanism is expressed in the form of probability; that is, each neighbor node is given a weight between 0 and 1 according to the distance. THECB reduces the data forwarding traffic of nodes whose discharge numbers are relatively higher than those of other nodes so that the unpredictable electromagnetic interference on communication can be weakened. We compare the energy consumption, energy consumption balance, and data forwarding traffic over various discharge numbers, network densities, and transmission radius.

This paper aims to provide an overview of digital twin applications in the food industry and analyze their challenges and potentials. Therefore, a literature review is executed to examine digital twin applications in the food supply chain. The applications found are classified according to a taxonomy and key elements to implement digital twins are identified. Further, the challenges and potentials of digital twin applications in the food industry are discussed. The survey revealed that the application of digital twins mainly targets the production (agriculture) or the food processing stage. Nearly all applications are used for monitoring and many for prediction. However, only a small amount focuses on the integration in systems for autonomous control or providing recommendations to humans.

The study site was the large-scale irrigation and drainage district of Chicamocha and Firavitoba (Usochicamocha) located in Boyacá - Colombia, where water is distributed from the Chicamocha riverbed. In the proposed system, irrigation is supervised and controlled in each field by an intelligent irrigation agent that autonomously prescribes and applies water amounts with agronomical criteria. The methodology was applied with real (cyber-physical) and virtual (simulated) intelligent agents and was extended to eleven pump stations that supply water to 5911 fields. Using a MQTT protocol, hundreds of irrigation intelligent agents report water prescriptions and crop characteristics to a master agent in each pump station, who creates a regional irrigation map to manage georeferenced field information and performs negotiation of water resources between agents according to supply availability. Field maps and intelligent irrigation agents can be visualized using devices with internet access.

The proposed approach enables two different IIoT scenarios, in which wireless transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) nodes are powered by a PoF system, enabling local and remote temperature data monitoring, with the purpose of achieving an intelligent and reliable process management in industrial production lines. In addition, the system performance is investigated as a function of the delivered electrical power and power transmission efficiency (PTE), which is the primary performance metric of a PoF system. We report 1.4 W electrical power deliver with PTE = 24%. Furthermore, we carry out a voltage stability analysis, demonstrating that the PoF system is capable of delivering stable voltage to a wide range of applications. Finally, we present a comparison of temperature measurements between the proposed approach and a conventional industrial programmable logic controller (PLC). The obtained results demonstrate that PoF might be considered as a potential technology to power and enhance the energy efficiency of IIoT sensing systems. © 2021 by the authors.

The safety and ongoing maintenance of the smart public transport system from cyberattacks are vitally important. To provide more comprehensive protection against potential cyberattacks, we propose a novel approach that combines blockchain technology and a deep learning method that can better protect the smart public transport system. By the creation of signed and verified blockchain blocks and chaining of hashed blocks, the blockchain in our proposal can withstand unauthorized integrity attack that tries to forge sensitive transport maintenance data and transactions associated with it. A hybrid deep learning-based method, which combines autoencoder (AE) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), in our proposal can effectively detect distributed denial of service (DDoS) attempts that can halt or block the urgent and critical exchange of transport maintenance data across the stakeholders. The experimental results of the hybrid deep learning evaluated on three different datasets (i.e., CICDDoS2019, CIC-IDS2017, and BoT-IoT) show that our deep learning model is effective to detect a wide range of DDoS attacks achieving more than 95% F1-score across all three datasets in average.

Great efforts have been dedicated to defending ASV against replay and synthetic speech; however, only a few approaches have been explored to deal with adversarial attacks. All the existing approaches to tackle adversarial attacks for ASV require the knowledge for adversarial samples generation, but it is impractical for defenders to know the exact attack algorithms that are applied by the in-the-wild attackers. This work is among the first to perform adversarial defense for ASV without knowing the specific attack algorithms. Inspired by self-supervised learning models (SSLMs) that possess the merits of alleviating the superficial noise in the inputs and reconstructing clean samples from the interrupted ones, this work regards adversarial perturbations as one kind of noise and conducts adversarial defense for ASV by SSLMs. Specifically, we propose to perform adversarial defense from two perspectives: 1) adversarial perturbation purification and 2) adversarial perturbation detection. The purification module aims at alleviating the adversarial perturbations in the samples and pulling the contaminated adversarial inputs back towards the decision boundary. Experimental results show that our proposed purification module effectively counters adversarial attacks and outperforms traditional filters from both alleviating the adversarial noise and maintaining the performance of genuine samples. The detection module aims at detecting adversarial samples from genuine ones based on the statistical properties of ASV scores derived by a unique ASV integrating with different number of SSLMs. Experimental results show that our detection module helps shield the ASV by detecting adversarial samples. Both purification and detection methods are helpful for defending against different kinds of attack algorithms. Moreover, since there is no common metric for evaluating the ASV performance under adversarial attacks, this work also formalizes evaluation metrics for adversarial defense considering both purification and detection based approaches into account. We sincerely encourage future works to benchmark their approaches based on the proposed evaluation framework. © 2014 IEEE.","adversarial attacks; adversarial defense; Automatic speaker verification; self-supervised learning","Job analysis; Network security; Perturbation techniques; Purification; Speech recognition; Supervised learning; Adversarial attack; Adversarial defense; Automatic speaker verification; Benchmark testing; Features extraction; Performance; Perturbation method; Self-supervised learning; Synthetic speech; Task analysis; Speech synthesis",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121389453

With 5G, new tech advancements and innovation are expected; 5G currently operates on software‐defined networking. This enables 5G to implement network slicing to meet the unique requirements of every application. As a result, 5G is more flexible and scalable than 4G LTE and previous generations. To avoid the growing risks of hacking, 5G cybersecurity needs some significant improvements. Some security concerns involve the network itself, while others focus on the devices connected to 5G. Both aspects present a risk to consumers, governments, and businesses alike. There is currently no real‐time vulnerability assessment framework that specifically addresses 5G Edge networks, with regard to their real‐time scalability and dynamic nature.

The proposed method considers both the vulnerability and 5G network dynamic factors such as latency and accessibility to find the potential attack graph paths where the attack might propagate in the network and quantifies the attack cost and security level of the network.

Anomalous instructions can introduce many potentially harmful threats to patients (e.g., radiation overexposure), to physical device components (e.g., manipulation of device motors), or to functionality (e.g., manipulation of medical images). Threats can occur due to cyber-attacks, human error (e.g., using the wrong protocol, or misconfiguring the protocol's parameters by a technician), or host PC software bugs. Thus, anomalous instructions might represent an intentional threat to the patient or to the device, a human error, or simply a non-optimal operation of the device. To protect medical devices, we propose a new dual-layer architecture. The architecture analyzes the instructions sent from the host PC to the physical components of the device, to detect anomalous instructions using two detection layers: (1) an unsupervised context-free (CF) layer that detects anomalies based solely on the instruction's content and inter-correlations; and (2) a supervised context-sensitive (CS) layer that detects anomalies in both the clinical objective and patient contexts using a set of supervised classifiers pre-trained for each specific context. The proposed dual-layer architecture was evaluated in the computed tomography (CT) domain, using 4842 CT instructions that we recorded, including two types of CF anomalous instructions, four types of clinical objective context instructions and four types of patient context instructions. The CF layer was evaluated using 14 unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. The CS layer was evaluated using six supervised classification algorithms applied to each context (i.e., clinical objective or patient). Adding the second CS supervised layer to the architecture improved the overall anomaly detection performance (by improving the detection of CS anomalous instructions [when they were not also CF anomalous]) from an F1 score baseline of 72.6%, to an improved F1 score of 79.1% to 99.5% (depending on the clinical objective or patient context used). Adding, the semantics-oriented CS layer enables the detection of CS anomalies using the semantics of the device's procedure, which is not possible when using just the purely syntactic CF layer. However, adding the CS layer also introduced a somewhat increased false positive rate (FPR), and thus reduced somewhat the specificity of the overall process. We conclude that by using both the CF and CS layers, a dual-layer architecture can better detect anomalous instructions to medical devices. The increased FPR might be reduced, in the future, through the use of stronger models, and by training them on more data. The improved accuracy, and the potential capability of adding explanations to both layers, might be useful for creating decision support systems for medical device technicians. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Anomaly detection; CT scanner; Cyber-security; Medical devices; Medical imaging devices","Anomaly detection; Computerized tomography; Crime; Errors; Medical imaging; Network security; Personal computers; Program debugging; Semantics; Anomaly detection; Computed tomography scanners; Context-free; Context-sensitive; Cyber security; Dual-layers; Imaging device; Medical Devices; Medical imaging device; Sensitive layers; Cybersecurity",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121144313

However, we demonstrate that it is insufficient in this paper (i.e., the network is no longer secure after the coordinator restarts).

Smart objects (enhanced devices or IoT services belonging to a smart system) interact and maintain relations which need of effective and efficient selection/filtering mechanisms to better meet users’ requirements. Recommender systems provide useful and customized information, properly selected and filtered, for users and services. This paper proposes a heuristic method to build a recommender engine in IoT environment exploiting swarm intelligence techniques. Smart objects are represented using real-valued vectors obtained through the Doc2Vec model, a word embedding technique able to capture the semantic context representing documents and sentences with dense vectors. The vectors are associated to mobile agents that move in a virtual 2D space following a bio-inspired model - the flocking model - in which agents perform simple and local operations autonomously obtaining a global intelligent organization. A similarity rule, based on the assigned vectors, was designed so enabling agents to discriminate among them. A closer positioning (clustering) of only similar agents is achieved. The intelligent positioning allows easy identifying of similar smart objects, thus enabling a fast and effective selection operations. Experimental evaluations have allowed to demonstrate the validity of the approach, and on how the proposed methodology allows obtaining an increasing in performance of about 50%, in terms of clustering quality and relevance, compared to other existing approaches. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Internet of Things; Multiagent systems; Recommender system; Swarm Intelligence; Word Embedding","Autonomous agents; Embeddings; Heuristic methods; Information filtering; Information management; Semantics; Swarm intelligence; Vector spaces; Vectors; Customized information; Embeddings; Filtering mechanism; Recommendation techniques; Smart environment; Smart objects; Smart System; Swarm intelligence; User requirements; Word embedding; Multi agent systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120980151

Building an effective network intrusion detection system that makes good use of deep learning methods is a challenging task. From the object perspective, different types of malicious attacks have a quite imbalance distribution, especially compared with normal network behaviour. From the feature perspective, the network behaviour description contains heterogeneous features, including numeric and categorical features and complex interactions among these features. To address these two challenges, we propose a novel Network Intrusion Detection System which by learning explicit and implicit feature interactions based on representation learning, i.e., RL-NIDS, which models the network behaviour by learning explicit and implicit feature interactions in both feature value representation and object representation spaces. Specifically, the RL-NIDS consists of two main modules, i.e., unsupervised Feature Value Representation Learning module (FVRL) which aims to learn the feature interactions among categorical features explicitly, and supervised Neural Network for object Representation Learning (NNRL) which aims to learn the implicit interactions in the representation space. Experiments show the effectiveness of RL-NIDS and the object representation learned by RL-NIDS with multiclass classification on two real-world datasets. The RL-NIDS outperforms the state-of-the-art feature selection-based methods and deep learning-based methods in terms of both overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The accuracy of classification of NSL-KDD and AWIDS dataset is 81.38% and 95.72%, respectively, achieve 3.9% and 0.9% improvements compare to the second-best method.

Recently, artificial intelligence-based approaches have been used in security domains. Two accessible datasets were used in this study. The datasets consist of simulated bot IoT network traffic data containing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack types. In the proposed approach, probabilistic Bayesian neural networks and normal Bayesian neural networks are used as the deep learning models. All features of the dataset were trained using two models. Then, the datasets were optimized using hunger games search (HGS) method and the most efficient parameters of the datasets were selected and retrained using deep learning models.

However, the serviceability in the smart manufacturing environment is still limited since most of the conventional services are conducted in a passively reactive mode. The knowledge as a service (KaaS) model is hence to be introduced to emphasize the cognitive capability by actively utilizing massive knowledge, where industrial knowledge graph (IKG) plays as the core to generate context-awareness and proactive services for the optimization of serviceability and productivity. Meanwhile, as building IKGs for specific industrial cases is still plagued by the small scale and the lack of continuous enrichment, ensuring the quality and availability of the IKG are still challenging. Aiming to fill this gap with a practical and systematic approach, this paper proposes a generic crowdsourcing approach for continuously evolving the IKG. Through the IKG continuous enrichment approach, IKG-enabled systems indicate the higher value creation ability to utilize knowledge as a kind of service, rather than just a kind of resource. To further illustrate the proposed approach, a case study of a printed circuit board (PCB) processing machine is given with discussions.

Therefore, this necessitates the design of an efficient security mechanism for IIoT environment. In this paper, we propose a hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC) based IIoT Certificateless Signcryption (IIoT-CS) scheme, with the aim of improving security while lowering computational and communication overhead in IIoT environment. HECC with 80-bit smaller key and parameters sizes offers similar security as elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) with 160-bit long key and parameters sizes.

We used Real or Random (RoR) model and the widely used automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) simulation tool for formal security analysis and proved that the IIoT-CS scheme provides resistance to various attacks.

Its methodological basis is represented by the collection and analysis of data on the level and nature of cybersecurity threats (Global Cybersecurity Index, the number of cyber incidents) and on the level of political stability (Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism indicator of the Worldwide Governance Index).

Therefore, the ability to distinguish different types of unknown network protocols is vital for network security. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on maximum frequent sequences for binary protocols, which can distinguish various unknown protocols to provide support for analyzing unknown protocol formats.We mine the maximum frequent sequences of protocolmessage sets in bytes. Andwe calculate the fuzzymembership of the protocolmessage to each maximum frequent sequence, which is based on fuzzy set theory. Then we construct the fuzzy membership vector for each protocol message. Finally, we adopt K-means++ to split different types of protocol messages into several clusters and evaluate the performance by calculating homogeneity, integrity, and Fowlkes andMallows Index (FMI).

While diverse automated detectors to battle FDI have been grown, such methodologies underestimate the strong analytical abilities of humans. This is while most proposed automated methods need observant human control. Although automated methods provide opportunities to improve scalability, humans can cope with exceptions and new attack trends. In this paper, to address the ever-increasing cyber-attack challenge in power systems, a visualization based attack detection framework using deep learning techniques is developed to provide human security researchers with improved techniques to uncover trends, identify outliers, recognize correlations, and communicate their results. Specifically, we first encode multivariate systems state time-series data into 2D colored images and then utilize a carefully designed deep convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier. The proposed method is developed to allow network operators to immediately capture and visually understand the statistical features of a network attack at a glance.

This paper provides a speculative parallel data detection algorithm to rapidly detect the potential threats and ensure data transmission security in the railway network. At first, the structure of the high-speed train control data received by the railway control center was analyzed and divided tentatively into small chunks to eliminate the inside dependencies. Then the traditional threat detection algorithm based on deterministic finite automaton was reformed by the speculative parallel optimization so that the inline relationship's influences that affected the data detection order could be avoided. At last, the speculative parallel detection algorithm would inspect the divided data chunks on a distributed platform. With the help of both the speculative parallel technique and the distributed platform, the detection deficiency for train control data was improved significantly. The results showed that the proposed algorithm exhibited better performance and scalability when compared with the traditional, non-parallel detection method, and massive train control data could be inspected and processed promptly. Now it has been proved by practical use that the proposed algorithm was stable and reliable.

Despite the prominence of ML in the domain of insider threat detection, none of the previous works have utilized ML techniques for building a hybrid solution that can take advantage of the misuse and anomaly insider threat detection. In this study, a new multilayer framework has been proposed for insider threat detection. The first layer of the framework is used for selecting the best insider threat detection classification model among many based on the multi-criteria decision making techniques. The selection procedure has been developed based on the integration of the entropy-VIKOR methods. For the second layer, a hybrid insider threat detection method has been proposed, where the Misuse Insider Threat Detection (MITD) model has been created using the random forest algorithm. Subsequently, using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, an anomaly insider threat detection algorithm has been developed. The proposed multilayer framework for insider threat detection has been evaluated by using the CERT r4.2 dataset. Results of the experiment demonstrate that the validity of the results produced by the selection framework is proven by the validation procedure obtained from previous research.

Exploiting the inherent graph topology of power systems as well as the spatial correlations of measurement data, this paper proposes an approach based on the graph neural network (GNN) to identify the presence and location of the FDIA. The proposed approach leverages the auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) type graph filters (GFs) which can better adapt to sharp changes in the spectral domain due to their rational type filter composition compared to the polynomial type GFs such as Chebyshev. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work based on GNN that automatically detects and localizes FDIA in power systems. Extensive simulations and visualizations show that the proposed approach outperforms the available methods in both detection and localization of FDIA for different IEEE test systems.

This paper proposes an optimal two-stage Kalman filter (OTS-KF) for simultaneous state and cyber-attack estimation in automatic generation control (AGC) system. Biases/cyber-attacks are modeled as unknown inputs in the AGC dynamics. Five types of cyber-attacks, i.e., false data injection (FDI), data replay attack, denial of service (DoS), scaling, and ramp attacks, are injected into the measurements and estimated using OTS-KF. As the load variations of each area are seldom available, OTS-KF is reformulated to estimate the states and outliers along with the load variations of the system. The proposed technique is validated on the benchmark two-area, three-area, and five-area power system models.

Software-defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function are the way to control and configure devices from a centralized location and have been proven to offer scalability and versatility to their deployed ecosystems. In this paper, we systematically review the adoption of SDN and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) for securing the IoT network from emerging threats. To this extent, we provide a comprehensive survey on security solutions based on SDN, Blockchain, NFV, and SDN/NFV proposed for the security of the IoT network. We have also identified open challenges in this domain which includes lack of standardization, low cost, and effective machine learning systems for identifying malicious traffic and handling great attack surface and different attack vectors. The deployed technologies exhibit positive strides in their usage for the provision of security in IoT environments offering security enhancements, scalability, and versatility. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Health risks; Home health care; Internet of things; Learning systems; Network function virtualization; Network security; Scalability; Security systems; Surveys; Transfer functions; Virtual reality; Internet of thing security; Internet technology; Network virtualization; Secure software; Security threats; Smart devices; Smart manufacturing; Smarter machines; Software-defined networks; Surrounding environment; Software defined networking",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119276192

An example is the stimulation of some brain areas to reduce the effects generated by Parkinson's disease. Despite the advances in recent years, cybersecurity on BCIs is an open challenge since attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities of invasive BCIs to induce malicious stimulation or treatment disruption, affecting neuronal activity. In this work, we design and implement a novel neuronal cyberattack called Neuronal Jamming (JAM), which prevents neurons from producing spikes. To implement and measure the JAM impact, and due to the lack of realistic neuronal topologies in mammalians, we have defined a use case using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to allow a simulated mouse to exit a particular maze. The resulting model has been translated to a biological neural topology, simulating a portion of a mouse's visual cortex. The impact of JAM on both biological and artificial networks is measured, analyzing how the attacks can both disrupt the spontaneous neural signaling and the mouse's capacity to exit the maze. Besides, another contribution of the work focuses on comparing the impacts of both JAM and FLO (an existing neural cyberattack), demonstrating that JAM generates a higher impact in terms of neuronal spike rate. As a final contribution, we discuss whether and how JAM and FLO attacks could induce the effects of neurodegenerative diseases if the implanted BCI had a comprehensive electrode coverage of the targeted brain regions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Brain-Computer Interfaces; Convolutional neural networks; Cybersecurity; Neuronal cyberattacks; Safety","Brain; Brain computer interface; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Cybersecurity; Mammals; Medical applications; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurons; Topology; Application scenario; Brain areas; Convolutional neural network; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Design and implements; Neuronal activities; Neuronal cyberattack; Parkinson's disease; Visual cortexes; Jamming",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119205994

To this end, we devise a system lookup and collection approach to obtain a representative sample of widely deployed EV Charging Station Management Systems (EVCSMS).

We consider a one-period scenario in which a firm may invest in information security measures to reduce the probability of a breach, in cyber-insurance or in a combination of both. The optimal combination of investment and insurance under the assumptions of the Gordon-Loeb model is investigated via consideration of the costs and benefits of investment in security alongside purchasing insurance at an independent premium rate. Under both exponential (constant absolute risk aversion) and logarithmic (constant relative risk aversion) utility functions it is found that when the insurance premium is below a certain value, utility is maximised with insurance and security investment. These results suggest that cyber-insurance is a worthwhile undertaking provided it is not overly costly. We believe this model to be the first attempt to integrate the Gordon-Loeb model into a classical microeconomic analysis of insurance, particularly using the Gordon-Loeb security breach functions to determine the probability of an insurance claim.

However, this integration of information technology exposes critical infrastructure to potential cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the interdependent nature of the grid's composite information and operational technology networks means that vulnerability extends across interconnected devices and systems. Therefore, a DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack, which is relatively easy to deploy but potentially highly disruptive, can be used strategically against the smart grid with particularly egregious results. In this paper, we take inspiration from epidemiological modelling to propose a compromise propagation model, alongside a behavioural DDoS model, to explore how dependencies between the grid's networks might influence the scale and impact of DDoS attacks. We found that the internal connectedness of a network amplifies the received impact of failures in an external network on which it is dependent. Furthermore, testing showed that alongside attack force, attack duration influences recovery times, due to both the quantity of resources consumed and the time needed to accumulate recoveries.

The use of cloud computing has realized the rapid increase of information in every field and the need for a centralized location for processing efficiently. This cloud is nowadays highly affected by internal threats of the user. Sensitive applications such as banking, hospital, and business are more likely affected by real user threats. An intruder is presented as a user and set as a member of the network. After becoming an insider in the network, they will try to attack or steal sensitive data during information sharing or conversation. The major issue in today's technological development is identifying the insider threat in the cloud network. When data are lost, compromising cloud users is difficult. Privacy and security are not ensured, and then, the usage of the cloud is not trusted. Several solutions are available for the external security of the cloud network. However, insider or internal threats need to be addressed. In this research work, we focus on a solution for identifying an insider attack using the artificial intelligence technique. An insider attack is possible by using nodes of weak users’ systems. They will log in using a weak user id, connect to a network, and pretend to be a trusted node. Then, they can easily attack and hack information as an insider, and identifying them is very difficult. These types of attacks need intelligent solutions. A machine learning approach is widely used for security issues. To date, the existing lags can classify the attackers accurately. This information hijacking process is very absurd, which motivates young researchers to provide a solution for internal threats. In our proposed work, we track the attackers using a user interaction behavior pattern and deep learning technique. The usage of mouse movements and clicks and keystrokes of the real user is stored in a database. The deep belief neural network is designed using a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) so that the layer of RBM communicates with the previous and subsequent layers. The result is evaluated using a Cooja simulator based on the cloud environment.

Consequently, the implementation of detection and defense against them is a concern among the research communities. But it is formidable to deploy extension modules to detect and mitigate attacks online in traditional networks, because devices are deficient of flexibility and scalability. To address the problem, we design and implement an online attack detection and mitigation system (ADMS) framework via the scalable and programmable Software Defined Networking (SDN). ADMS is installed on SDN controllers and conforms to the OpenFlow policy without extra devices. ADMS consists of two modules: the two-phase detection module and the mitigation module. The two-phase detection module combines the new port traffic feature and the Lightgbm classifier based on flow table statistics traffic to precisely detect LDoS attacks. The mitigation module utilizes the novel Sequence Matching based Dynamic Series Analysing (SMDSA) algorithm to locate the attacker, and efficiently mitigates attack traffic by packet filter. The SMDSA algorithm distinguishes the victim port from benign ports by calculating the anomaly score of each port. Our evaluation on a prototype implementation of ADMS shows that the framework is able to precisely identify and efficiently mitigate LDoS attacks in real-time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Low-rate denial of service attacks; Mitigation module; Sequence matching based dynamic series analysing algorithm; Software defined networking; Two-phase detection module","Network security; Signal detection; Software defined networking; Denialof- service attacks; Detection modules; Dynamic series; Low rates; Low-rate denial of service attack; Mitigation module; Phase detection; Sequence matching; Sequence matching based dynamic series analyzing algorithm; Software-defined networkings; Two phase; Two-phase detection module; Denial-of-service attack",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118901808

In order to deal with a network resource constraint, a novel two-event-generator scheme over both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels is proposed to reduce the transmission frequency of system states and control commands, while maintaining desired system performance. More specifically, one of the event-generators is a time-varying memory-based event-triggered scheme (METS), and the other is the traditional event-triggered scheme (ETS). On the other hand, in order to incorporate network security, a new model of memory-based NCSs is established under random deception attacks. Then, sufficient conditions for preserving the asymptotic stability of uncertain NCSs are proposed by using the Lyapunov functional method. Furthermore, co-design criteria are derived for determining both the memory-based state feedback controller gains and event-triggering parameter matrices. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by a quarter-car suspension system. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Deception attacks; ETS; Time-varying METS; Two-event-generator scheme; Uncertain NCSs","Active suspension systems; Controllers; Discrete time control systems; Lyapunov functions; Network security; Networked control systems; State feedback; Uncertainty analysis; Deception attack; Event generators; Event-triggered; Event-triggered controls; Event-triggered scheme; Time varying; Time-varying memory-based event-triggered scheme; Two-event-generator scheme; Uncertain NCS; Asymptotic stability",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118841781

To reduce the energy used by idle listening, a low-duty cycle is often used in an event-sparse wireless sensor network. However, low-duty cycles bring large end-to-end delays. In this paper, a listen interval adaptive adjustment (LIAA) scheme is proposed to adjust the listen interval (LI) of a node to reduce end-to-end delays while maintaining the long lifetime of a network. The key idea is to make full use of the energy consumption imbalance in a network, to allow nodes away from the sink to use the residual energy to add listen intervals. The LIAA scheme has 3 sub-strategies. One is the basic add listen interval (BALI) strategy, in which the parent node adds listen intervals in the fixed active slots of its child nodes. Another strategy is the consecutive listen (CL) scheme, which is based on BALI, and listen intervals are added consecutively. The third strategy is the random add listen interval (RALI) scheme, which uses the idea of randomness to add listen intervals. The extensive theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the LIAA scheme proposed in this paper has better performance. Compared with the traditional scheme, the delays in the BALI scheme, CL scheme and RALI scheme were reduced by 24.03%, 23.45% and 39.41%, respectively, while the lifetime of the network was maintained. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Delay; Duty cycle; Energy saving; Lifetime; Listen interval adaptive adjustment; Sensor based system","Energy utilization; Internet of things; Sensor nodes; Adaptive adjustment; Delay; Duty-cycle; Energy savings; Energy-savings; Lifetime; Listen interval adaptive adjustment; Low duty-cycles; Low-duty cycles; Sensor based systems; Energy conservation",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118827032

Recently, research on DDoS attacks detection in SDN has focused on investigation of how to leverage data plane programmability, enabled by P4 language, to detect attacks directly in network switches, with marginal involvement of SDN controllers. In order to effectively address cybersecurity management in SDN architectures, we investigate the potential of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to perform automated DDoS Attacks Detection (DAD), specifically focusing on Transmission Control Protocol SYN flood attacks. We compare two different DAD architectures, called Standalone and Correlated DAD, where traffic features collection and attack detection are performed locally at network switches or in a single entity (e.g., in SDN controller), respectively. We combine the capability of ML and P4-enabled data planes to implement real-time DAD. Illustrative numerical results show that, for all tested ML algorithms, accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are above 98% in most cases, and classification time is in the order of few hundreds of μ s in the worst case. Considering real-time DAD implementation, significant latency reduction is obtained when features are extracted at the data plane by using P4 language.

The main digital watermarking application include active attackers whose goal is to destroy or damage watermarks. Thus, digital watermarking schemes must be robust to attacks. Despite of the large number of existing digital watermarking schemes, a comprehensive analysis of their robustness towards various attacks does not exist. Our study aims to fill this gap.

An evaluation on real incident reports shows that the summarization algorithm reduces false positives and improves average precision by 41% while reducing average incident report size up to 79%. Together, the visualization and summarization algorithm generate compact representations of cyber narratives that earned praise from a SOC analyst.

Given this background, we designed a solution to detect intrusions using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) Computing. We created two separate categories to handle the attack and non-attack events in the system. The findings of this study indicate that this approach was significantly effective.

Due to more and more online security and data hijacking attacks, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data are considered serious issues in HIoT applications. In this regard, lightweight block ciphers (LBCs) are promising in resourceconstrained environment where security is the primary consideration. The prevalent challenge while designing an LBC for the HIoT environment is how to ascertain platform performance, cost, and security. Most of the existing LBCs primarily focus on text data or grayscale images. The main focus of this paper is about securing color images in a cost-effective way.We emphasis high confidentiality of color images captured by cameras in resource-constrained smartphones, and high confidentiality of sensitive images transmitted by low-power sensors in IoT systems. In order to reduce computational complexity and simulation time, the proposed Lightweight Symmetric Block Cipher (LSBC) exploits chaos-based confusion-diffusion operations at the inter-block level using a single round. The strength of LSBC is assessed by cryptanalysis, while it is ranked by comparing it to other privacy-preserving schemes.

At the same time, several researchers have started to adopt a common distributed ledger, such as a Blockchain, for building advanced solutions in the IoT. However, due to the high dimensionality of this problem, enabling a trust and reputation mechanism by leveraging a Blockchain-based technology could give rise to several performance issues in the IoT. In this paper, we propose a two-tier Blockchain framework to increase the security and autonomy of smart objects in the IoT by implementing a trust-based protection mechanism. In this framework, smart objects are suitably grouped into communities. To reduce the complexity of the solution, the first-tier Blockchain is local and is used only to record probing transactions performed to evaluate the trust of an object in another one of the same community or of a different community. Periodically, after a time window, these transactions are aggregated and the obtained values are stored in the second-tier Blockchain. Specifically, stored values are the reputation of each object inside its community and the trust of each community in the other ones of the framework.

Distributed denial of services (DDoS) is a common attack on SDN due to its centralized architecture, especially at the control layer of the SDN that has a network-wide impact.Machine learning is now widely used for fast detection of these attacks. In this paper, some important feature selection methods for machine learning on DDoS detection are evaluated. The selection of optimal features reflects the classification accuracy of the machine learning techniques and the performance of the SDN controller.A comparative analysis of feature selection andmachine learning classifiers is also derived to detect SDNattacks. The experimental results show that the Random forest (RF) classifier trains the more accurate model with 99.97% accuracy using features subset by the Recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

As such, traditional BACS encompass extensively automated buildings managed in an integrated manner, with the support of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems and specialized industry standards such as BACnet and KNX. More recently, the increasing adoption of IP-connected, IoT-like devices for automating single tasks led to a substantial increase in the number of automated building functions (especially for the smart home domain), although rarely with extensive or integrated automation levels. The interconnection with the building local area network (LAN) and even the Internet, comes with the cost of a wider exposition to attacks, that can either begin inside of the building or be initiated from anywhere outside of it. In contrast with other domains that recently received substantial attention (e.g. industrial control and automation systems), the security of BACS has been addressed in a somehow more superficial and less structured manner. Nevertheless, recent security incidents, combined with the fact that these systems are becoming more interconnected with the building networks and the Internet, are raising security concerns.

Several shortcomings of a network system can be leveraged by an attacker to get unauthorized access through malicious traffic. Safeguard from such attacks requires an efficient automatic system that can detect malicious traffic timely and avoid system damage. Currently, many automated systems can detect malicious activity, however, the efficacy and accuracy need further improvement to detect malicious traffic from multi-domain systems. The present study focuses on the detection of malicious traffic with high accuracy using machine learning techniques. The proposed approach used two datasets UNSW-NB15 and IoTID20 which contain the data for IoT-based traffic and local network traffic, respectively. Both datasets were combined to increase the capability of the proposed approach in detecting malicious traffic from local and IoT networks, with high accuracy. Horizontally merging both datasets requires an equal number of features which was achieved by reducing feature count to 30 for each dataset by leveraging principal component analysis (PCA). The proposed model incorporates stacked ensemble model extra boosting forest (EBF) which is a combination of tree-based models such as extra tree classifier, gradient boosting classifier, and random forest using a stacked ensemble approach.

In spite of, so many developments in tools and technology, there are few effective schemes to detect denial of service attacks in SDON. In our research work, we proposed a traffic anomaly detection scheme by analyzing and defining the specific security threat non-directional denial of service attack (ND-DoS) faced by the SDON. In this scheme, we first designed the function construction of the controller and the extension of the OpenFlow protocol, and then used the adaptive threshold detection algorithm based on time sliding window (TSW-ATD) and the repeated flow detection algorithm (RFD) to complete the first detection and re-detection detection of abnormal traffic, and finally designed a general formulaic measurement method.

We have studied general cybersecurity frameworks, cybersecurity standards, research literature, and first principles of systems theory and process engineering.

Current solutions relying on many temporal constrains have limited generalization for new threats. In this paper, these two challenges are addressed, whereby we introduce domain adaptation to broaden the availability of data to improve APT detection while determining the relevance of separating samples based on their reported use. With the ability to introduce new data, namely in the APT-Executable (APT-EXE) dataset, we propose a new method to adapt over 4500 APT malware log samples to our target domain and achieve superior detection performance. A combination of transductive and inductive adaptation is applied by adapting the distribution of APT file system interaction. Adaptation is applied to retrieve system driven access and usage structure and functionality interaction footprints. The aligned distribution of log entries is projected within a Riemannian manifold. A weighted geodesics distance between APT samples and unseen log entries is measured, and APT driven Bayes net (APT-BN) is probed for queries for respective techniques respectively for adaptation and footprint methods. The proposed method is evaluated on 183 different Windows APT samples for 207 processes from 20 documented APT campaigns 2018 and onward. Comparisons are made based on the proposed method, multiple state-of-the-art log embedding techniques, and established text processing techniques.

Currently, most secondary controls in DC microgrids heavily rely on communications, making them specifically vulnerable to cyber attacks. This paper presents a resilient distributed control based on the average consensus algorithm and the proportional-integral (PI) consensus algorithm to enhance the system resilience against denial of service attacks and improve the microgrid stability, particularly in the presence of constant power loads. The proposed control casts the average voltage restoration problem into an optimization problem, and because of this, the voltage control is immune to the communication damage caused by malicious denial of service attacks. Moreover, the small-signal stability model of the DC microgrid with distributed energy storages and constant power loads is established, and the impacts of varying constant power loads, controller parameters and communication topology on the system stability are analyzed.

This technology is used not only as a new way with the aim of enhancing the cyber and physical security of power systems, but also has been applied to enhance the exchanged information between units. When Fuel Cell (FC), photovoltaic cells (PV) and wind turbines (WT) are used as sources of distributed generation (DG), there will be a situation called Islanding Micro-Grid (MG), so that this situation has the ability to control voltage, frequency and current of the system with no dependence on the utility. Hence, for overcoming load variations and disturbances, designing and implementing a robust controller is vital. Accordingly, a robust General Type-2 Fuzzy sliding mode controller (GT2FSMC) on the basis of gray wolf optimization algorithm is presented in the following study with the purpose of enhancing the power sharing amongst the distributed generations operating in the off-grid MG. The offered controller, in addition to warrant the stability and robust versus uncertainties of the lumped generated via extrinsic disturbances and un-modelled dynamics, has the ability to significantly decrease the control chattering inherent in primary sliding mode control. In the following paper, it is assumed that there are two distributed generations, each with specific duties. One has the duty of regulating the frequency and voltage through a reference signal, and another is responsible for working in load current control mode with the aim of sharing load correctly among each of them. For stopping malicious attacks, an assured policy framework according to the blockchain (BC) has been created to enhance the security of interchanged data among production units. Plus, two low-voltage parallel DG units exist in the MG. With the aim of evaluating the mentioned way, the simulation results have been done via MATLAB environment. According to the outcomes, it can be concluded that this mentioned controller has the ability of providing lower steady state error and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) with faster response in comparison to the further controllers that generally are used. The simulation results show that the DG unit operations within the islanding MG have the ability of coordinating successfully under that mentioned control system with the aim of confirming stable operation of the throughout MG. © 2021","Blockchain Technology; Data exchanged; DC/AC converter; General type-2 fuzzy controller; Gray wolf algorithm; Islanding mode; Micro-grid; Sliding mode controller","Blockchain; Controllers; Decision making; Distributed power generation; Electric inverters; Electric power transmission networks; Electronic data interchange; Fuel cells; MATLAB; Network security; Photovoltaic cells; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; DC-AC converter; Fuzzy controllers; General type-2 fuzzy; General type-2 fuzzy controller; Gray wolf algorithm; Gray wolves; Islanding modes; Microgrid; Sliding mode controller; Sliding mode control",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117698560

However, the literature reveals an inconsistent landscape regarding the effect of response actions on customers or investors. Using an event study, we show that the response actions impact a company's stock value and that this impact does not necessarily match the impact on the customer. We code the real-world response actions to data breaches, examining their impact on investor behavior using stock value. The results show that data breaches involving customer data have a negative impact on stock value. In addition, an apology for a data breach has been found to have harmful effects on investor behavior. Whereas justifying the data breach has no or a positive impact. These results add to the investor-focused literature on data breaches, showing that an impact on stock value can emerge from response actions. The literature on data breaches can be informed by the fact that not just is the customer perspective important, but also reactions from other affected groups should be included in formulating a response strategy.

In particular, these devices increasingly include critical systems such as power grids and medical institutions, possibly causing tremendous consequences in the case of a successful cybersecurity attack. A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is one of the main components to detect ongoing attacks by differentiating normal from malicious traffic. Anomaly-based NIDS, more specifically unsupervised methods previously proved promising for their ability to detect known as well as zero-day attacks without the need for a labeled dataset. Despite decades of development by researchers, anomaly-based NIDS are only rarely employed in real-world applications, most possibly due to the lack of generalization power of the proposed models. This article first evaluates four unsupervised machine learning methods on two recent datasets and then defines their generalization strength using a novel inter-dataset evaluation strategy estimating their adaptability. Results show that all models can present high classification scores on an individual dataset but fail to directly transfer those to a second unseen but related dataset. Specifically, the accuracy dropped on average 25.63% in an inter-dataset setting compared to the conventional evaluation approach. This generalization challenge can be observed and tackled in future research with the help of the proposed evaluation strategy in this paper. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cybersecurity; Generalization strength; Inter-dataset evaluation; Intrusion detection; Network security; Unsupervised techniques","Classification (of information); Electric power transmission networks; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network security; Zero-day attack; Cyber security; Evaluation strategies; Generalisation; Generalization strength; Inter-dataset evaluation; Intrusion-Detection; Network intrusion detection systems; Networks security; Unsupervised machine learning; Unsupervised techniques; Cybersecurity",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117524932

It provides safety and infotainment applications for road users. It relies on the exchange of real-time messages known as beacons to achieve connectivity and ensure safety. The beacons contain the position, the identifier and the velocity of the vehicle. This data can be eavesdropped by a malicious attacker to construct a full trajectory of a target vehicle and track its user. The tracking violates the on-road users’ location privacy. It is the cyber-equivalent of stalking. Its consequences may be directly related to the user’s safety. Therefore, the privacy issue in CE-IoV is crucial and preserving it is a priority. In this paper, we propose a location privacy preserving solution for CE-IoV users. The solution relies on cooperativeness, obfuscation, and silence to reduce linkability and tracking. We proved its feasibility using a game theoretic approach. We further analysed the with simulations the proposed scheme performance and resiliency to Global Passive Attacker (GPA). The modelled GPA executes four eavesdropping and linking attacks to track the vehicles which are: semantic, syntactic, observation and mapping linking attacks.

Existing NIDSs can easily identify those intrusions that have been frequently witnessed in the network (majority attacks), but they cannot identify new and infrequent intrusions (minority attacks) accurately. Moreover, such systems solely focus on maximizing the overall Attack Detection Rate while overlooking the number of false alarms. To address these issues, this paper proposes CSE-IDS, a three-layer NIDS, based on Cost-Sensitive Deep Learning and Ensemble algorithms. Layer 1 of the proposed CSE-IDS uses Cost-Sensitive Deep Neural Network to separate normal traffic from suspicious network traffic. These suspicious samples are then sent to Layer 2, which uses the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm to classify them into normal class, different majority attack classes, and a single class representing all minority attack classes. At last, Random Forest is used at Layer 3 to classify the minority attacks identified at Layer 2 into their respective classes. The performance of the proposed CSE-IDS was evaluated on the NSL-KDD, CIDDS-001, and CICIDS2017 datasets with respect to Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score, ROC curve, AUC values, and computational times. The proposed system outperforms its counterparts by achieving a high Attack Detection Rate for both majority attacks and minority attacks present in the network. Further, it minimizes the number of false alarms by correctly segregating normal traffic from attack traffic. The obtained results confirm that the proposed CSE-IDS can be deployed in the real world for performing network-based intrusion detection. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bagging; Boosting; Cost-sensitive algorithms; Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Network-based intrusion detection system","Computer crime; Data Link Layer; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Errors; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Multilayer neural networks; Network security; Attack detection; Bagging; Boosting; Cost-sensitive; Cost-sensitive algorithm; Cyber security; Deep learning; Detection rates; Ensemble algorithms; Network based intrusion detection systems; Cybersecurity",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117215059

IoT devices deliver great convenience to our daily lives; nevertheless, they are becoming attractive attacking targets. Compromised IoT devices can result in the exposure of user privacy, damage to network security, or even threats to personal safety. In a rush for convenience and marketability, the security of these devices is usually less considered during production and even ignored. Under these circumstances, Remote Attestation (RA) becomes a valuable security service. It outsources the computation and verification burden to a resource-rich party, e.g., server, to ease its on-device implementation, making it suitable for protocol extensions. In this paper, we investigate the state-of-the-art RA schemes from different perspectives, aiming to offer a comprehensive understanding of this security service. Specifically, we summarize the basis of RA. We set up an elaborate adversarial model by systematizing existing RA schemes. Then we put forward the evaluation criteria from protection capability, performance, network adaptability, and attestation quality. According to the adversarial model, we classify existing RA schemes into five categories to show the various characteristics.

To attain the maximum usage of bandwidth, a dynamic bandwidth allocation mechanism is integrated with the ETC approach on the basis of resource availability and error between the current state and equilibrium state. This bandwidth reservation and allocation approach aim at detecting attacks and assigning bandwidth to the different channels of distribution networks. Then, by virtue of the Lyapunov approach, the exponential stability criteria are established. Further, the exclusion of Zeno behavior of the designed systems is proved during the control process.

Earlier studies have developed different approaches for the detection of spam bots in OSN. But those techniques primarily concentrated on hand-crafted features to capture the features of malicious users while the application of Deep Learning (DL) models needs to be explored. With this motivation, the current research article proposes a Spam Bot Detection technique using Hybrid DL model abbreviated as SBD-HDL. The proposed SBD-HDL technique focuses on the detection of spam bots that exist in OSNs. The technique has different stages of operations such as pre-processing, classification, and parameter optimization. Besides, SBD-HDL technique hybridizes Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for spam bot classification process. In order to enhance the detection performance of GCN-RNN model, hyperparameters are tuned using Lion Optimization Algorithm (LOA). Both hybridization of GCN-RNN and LOA-based hyperparameter tuning process make the current work, a first-of-its-kind in this domain. The experimental validation of the proposed SBD-HDL technique, conducted upon benchmark dataset, established the supremacy of the technique since it was validated under different measures. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

The IoT fitness devices collect trainee data that is being used for various decision-making. However, it will face numerous security and privacy issues towards its realization. This work focuses on IoT security, especially DoS/DDoS attacks. In this paper, we have proposed a novel blockchain-enabled protocol (BEP) that uses the notion of a self-exposing node (SEN) approach for securing fitness IoT applications. The blockchain and SDN architectures are employed to enhance IoT security by a highly preventive security monitoring, analysis and response system. The proposed approach helps in detecting the DoS/DDoS attacks on the IoT fitness system and then mitigating the attacks. The BEP is used for handling Blockchain-related activities and SEN could be a sensor or actuator node within the fitness IoT system. SEN provides information about the inbound and outbound traffic to the BEP which is used to analyze the DoS/DDoS attacks on the fitness IoT system. The SEN calculates the inbound and outbound traffic features’ entropies and transmits them to the Blockchain in the form of transaction blocks. The BEP picks the whole mined blocks’ transactions and transfers them to the SDN controller node. The controller node correlates the entropies data of SENs and decides about the DoS or DDoS attack. So, there are two decision points, one is SEN, and another is the controller. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, several experiments are performed and results concerning the entropy values and attack detection rate are obtained.

Accessing the big data generated by these applications in Cloud Servers (CSs), requires higher levels of authenticity and confidentiality during communication conducted through the Internet. Signcryption is one of the most promising approaches nowadays for overcoming such obstacles, due to its combined nature, i.e., signature and encryption. A number of researchers have developed schemes to address issues related to access control in the IoT literature, however, the majority of these schemes are based on homogeneous nature. This will be neither adequate nor practical for heterogeneous IoT environments. In addition, these schemes are based on bilinear pairing and elliptic curve cryptography, which further requires additional processing time and more communication overheads that is inappropriate for real-time communication. Consequently, this paper aims to solve the above-discussed issues, we proposed an access control scheme for IoT environments using heterogeneous signcryption scheme with the efficiency and security hardiness of hyperelliptic curve. Besides the security services such as replay attack prevention, confidentiality, integrity, unforgeability, non-repudiations, and forward secrecy, the proposed scheme has very low computational and communication costs, when it is compared to existing schemes. This is primarily because of hyperelliptic curve lighter nature of key and other parameters. The AVISPA tool is used to simulate the security requirements of our proposed scheme and the results were under two backbends (Constraint Logic-based Attack Searcher (CL-b-AtSER) and On-the-Fly Model Checker (ON-t-FL-MCR)) proved to be SAFE when the presented scheme is coded in HLPSL language. This scheme was proven to be capable of preventing a variety of attacks, including confidentiality, integrity, unforgeability, non-repudiation, forward secrecy, and replay attacks. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Routing attacks have the potential to destroy and degrade the functionality of WSNs. A trustworthy routing system is essential for routing security and WSN efficiency. Numerous methods have been implemented to build trust between routing nodes, including the use of cryptographic methods and centralized routing. Nonetheless, the majority of routing techniques are unworkable in reality due to the difficulty of properly identifying untrusted routing node activities. At the moment, there is no effective way to avoid malicious node attacks. As a consequence of these concerns, this paper proposes a trusted routing technique that combines blockchain infrastructure, deep neural networks, and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to improve the security and efficiency of WSN routing. To authenticate the transmission process, the suggested methodology makes use of a Proof of Authority (PoA) mechanism inside the blockchain network. The validation group required for proofing is chosen using a deep learning approach that prioritizes each node’s characteristics. MDPs are then utilized to determine the suitable next-hop as a forwarding node capable of securely transmitting messages. According to testing data, our routing system outperforms current routing algorithms in a 50% malicious node routing scenario. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

The current IoUT applications face difficulty in delivering a reliable communication system due to the various technical limitations of IoUT environment such as low data rate, attenuation, limited bandwidth, limited battery, limited memory, connectivity problem, etc. One of the significant applications of IoUT include monitoring underwater diver networks. In order to perform a reliable and energy-efficient communication system in the underwater diver networks, a smart underwater hybrid software-defined modem (UHSDM) for the mobile ad-hoc network was developed that is used for selecting the best channel/medium among acoustic, visible light communication (VLC), and infrared (IR) based on the criteria established within the system. However, due to the mobility of underwater divers, the developed UHSDM meets the challenges such as connectivity errors, frequent link failure, transmission delay caused by re-routing, etc. During emergency, the divers are most at the risk of survival. To deal with diver mobility, connectivity, energy efficiency, and reducing the latency in ADN, a handover mechanism based on pre-built UHSDM is proposed in this paper. This paper focuses on (1) design of UHSDM for ADN (2) propose the channel selection mechanism in UHSDM for selecting the best medium for handover and (3) propose handover protocol in ADN. The implementation result shows that the proposed mechanism can be used to find the new route for divers in advance and the latency can be reduced significantly. Additionally, this paper shows the real field experiment of air tests and underwater tests with various distances.

For example, UAVs (or drone) technology is increasingly used in crowd monitoring solutions due to its wider air footprint and the ability to capture data in real time. However, due to the open atmosphere, drones can easily be lost or captured by attackers when reporting information to the crowd management center. In addition, the attackers may initiate malicious detection to disrupt the crowd-sensing communication network. Therefore, security and privacy are one of the most significant challenges faced by drones or the Internet of Drones (IoD) that supports the Internet of Things (IoT). In the literature, we can find some authenticated key agreement (AKA) schemes to protect access control between entities involved in the IoD environment.

In this paper, we propose an enhanced AKA solution for crowd monitoring applications that require secure communication between drones and controlling entities.

Current DDoS attack protection services filter out the DDoS attack packets in the middle of the path from the attacker to the servers. Some of the DDoS protection systems filter them out at the victim server. As a result, unnecessary attack traffic congests the network and wastes bandwidth. This can be minimized if we block them as early as possible. In this paper, we propose a DDoS attack protection system by using the filter router. The victim needs to wisely select and send filters to a subset of filter routers to minimize attack traffic and blockage of legitimate users (LUs). Many filters can easily minimize the attack traffic and blockage of LUs, but it is costly to the victim. So, we formulate two problems with different settings for selecting filter routers given a constraint on the number of filters. We propose dynamic programming solutions for both problems. Both problems consider the blockage of all attack traffic before it reaches the victim.

In recent years, researchers have used different machine learning methods to detect network attacks without relying on those signatures. The methods generally have a high false-positive rate which is not adequate for an industry-ready intrusion detection product. In this study, we propose and implement a new method that relies on a modular deep neural network for reducing the false positive rate in the XSS attack detection system. Experiments were performed using a dataset consists of 1000 malicious and 10000 benign sample.

IoT gadgets generate huge volumes of patient data in healthcare domain, which can be examined on cloud over the available storage and computation resources in mobile gadgets. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is one of the deadliest diseases that has high mortality rate across the globe. The current research work presents a novel IoT and cloud-based CKD diagnosis model called Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA)-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) model abbreviated as FPA-DNN. The steps involved in the presented FPA-DNN model are data collection, preprocessing, Feature Selection (FS), and classification. Primarily, the IoT gadgets are utilized in the collection of a patient's health information. The proposed FPA-DNN model deploys Oppositional Crow Search (OCS) algorithm for FS, which selects the optimal subset of features from the preprocessed data. The application of FPA helps in tuning the DNN parameters for better classification performance. The simulation analysis of the proposed FPA-DNN model was performed against the benchmark CKD dataset. The results were examined under different aspects.

Due to extensive data exchange over the Internet, the smart grid faces many security challenges that have led to data loss, data compromise, and high power consumption. Moreover, the lack of hardware protection and physical attacks reduce the overall performance of the smart grid network. We proposed the BLIDSE model (Blockchain-based secure quantum key distribution and Intrusion Detection System in Edge Enables Smart Grid Network) to address these issues. The proposed model includes five phases: The first phase is blockchain-based secure user authentication, where all smart meters are first registered in the blockchain, and then the blockchain generates a secret key. The blockchain verifies the user ID and the secret key during authentication matches the one authorized to access the network. The secret key is shared during transmission through secure quantum key distribution (SQKD). The second phase is the lightweight data encryption, for which we use a lightweight symmetric encryption algorithm, named Camellia. The third phase is the multi-constraint-based edge selection; the data are transmitted to the control center through the edge server, which is also authenticated by blockchain to enhance the security during the data transmission. We proposed a perfect matching algorithm for selecting the optimal edge. The fourth phase is a dual intrusion detection system which acts as a firewall used to drop irrelevant packets, and data packets are classified into normal, physical errors and attacks, which is done by Double Deep Q Network (DDQN). The last phase is optimal user privacy management. In this phase, smart meter updates and revocations are done, for which we proposed Forensic based Investigation Optimization (FBI), which improves the security of the smart grid network. The simulation is performed using network simulator NS3.26, which evaluates the performance in terms of computational complexity, accuracy, false detection, and false alarm rate. The proposed BLIDSE model effectively mitigates cyber-attacks, thereby contributing to improved security in the network. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Failing to do so may cause a serious loss of reputation as well as business. At the same time, modern network traffic has dynamic patterns, high complexity, and large volumes that make it more difficult to detect malware early. The ability to learn tasks sequentially is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence. Existing neurogenetic computation models with deep-learning techniques are able to detect complex patterns; however, the models have limitations, including catastrophic forgetfulness, and require intensive computational resources. As defense systems using deep-learning models require more time to learn new traffic patterns, they cannot perform fully online (on-the-fly) learning. Hence, an intelligent attack/malware detection system with on-the-fly learning capability is required. For this paper, a memory-prediction framework was adopted, and a simplified single cell assembled sequential hierarchical memory (s.SCASHM) model instead of the hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) model is proposed to speed up learning convergence to achieve on-the-fly learning. The s.SCASHM consists of a Single Neuronal Cell (SNC) model and a simplified Sequential Hierarchical Superset (SHS) platform. The s.SCASHM is implemented as the prediction engine of a user behavior analysis tool to detect insider attacks/anomalies.

Particularly, some of the nodes in IoT are mobile and dynamic in nature. Hence maintaining the link among the nodes, efficient bandwidth of the links among the mobile nodes with increased life time is a big challenge in IoT as it integrates mobile nodes with static nodes for data processing. In such networks, many routing-problems arise due to difficulties in energy and bandwidth based quality of service. Due to the mobility and finite nature of the nodes, transmission links between intermediary nodes may fail frequently, thus affecting the routing-performance of the network and the accessibility of the nodes. The existing protocols do not focus on the transmission links and energy, bandwidth and link stability of the nodes, but node links are significant factors for enhancing the quality of the routing. Link stability helps us to define whether the node is within or out of a coverage range. This paper proposed an Optimal Energy and bandwidth based Link Stability Routing (OEBLS) algorithm, to improve the link stable route with minimized error rate and throughput. In this paper, the optimal route from the source to the sink is determined based on the energy and bandwidth, link stability value. Among the existing routes, the sink node will choose the optimal route which is having less link stability value. Highly stable link is determined by evaluating link stability value using distance and velocity. Residual-energy of the node is estimated using the current energy and the consumed energy. Consumed energy is estimated using transmitted power and the received power. Available bandwidth in the link is estimated using the idle time and channel capacity with the consideration of probability of collision. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

These changes can lead to new cyber risks, and should therefore be considered for a security threat model. To this end, we constructed an edge system to study security in two directions, hardware and software. First, on the hardware side, we want to autonomically defend against hardware attacks such as side channel attacks by configuring field programmable gate array (FPGA) which is suitable for edge computing and identifying communication status to control the communication method according to priority. In addition, on the software side, data collected on the server performs end-to-end encryption via symmetric encryption keys. Also, we modeled autonomous defense systems on the server by using machine learning which targets to incoming and outgoing logs. Server log utilizes existing intrusion detection datasets that should be used in real-world environments. Server log was used to detect intrusion early by modeling an intrusion prevention system to identify behaviors that violate security policy, and to utilize the existing intrusion detection data set that should be used in a real environment.

The software is organized as a multi-level simulator that permits to simulate a virtual environment, made of many nodes running the protocol of a specific Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), such as the Bitcoin or the Ethereum blockchains. This virtual environment is executed on top of a lower-level Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network overlay, which can be structured based on different topologies and with a given number of nodes and edges. Functionalities at different levels of abstraction are managed separately, by different software modules and with different time granularity. This allows for accurate simulations, where (and when) it is needed, and enhances the simulation performance. Using LUNES-Blockchain, it is possible to simulate different types of attacks on the DLT. In this paper, we specifically focus on the P2P layer, considering the selfish mining, the 51% attack and the Sybil attack. For which concerns selfish mining and the 51% attack, our aim is to understand how much the hash-rate (i.e. a general measure of the processing power in the blockchain network) of the attacker can influence the outcome of the misbehavior.

In order to detect and block such malicious URL attacks, it is best that individuals not click on suspicious URL addresses. However, this is difficult because the contents that contain the URLs are alluring. Before, malicious URLs were detected through Blacklist/Whitelist techniques, but they couldn't protect users from new and variant attacks. On this, a malicious URL detection method based on the difference in length (amount of search volume) of normal and abnormal URLs was studied using the search engines. However, this technique showed little difference in the search volume of normal/abnormal URLs when searched from a low-profile URL. In addition when an abnormal URL is very similar to the original URL, there is almost no difference in the search volume since abnormal URLs change the automatic search of the portal site's search engine, making it impossible to be detected.

Most networks compromised by intruders are those where the exchange of data is at high risk. The main objective of this paper is to present a solution for secure exchange of attack signatures between the nodes of a distributed network. Malicious activities are monitored and detected by the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that operates with nodes connected to a distributed network. The IDS operates in two phases, where the first phase consists of detection of anomaly attacks using an ensemble of classifiers such as Random forest, Convolutional neural network, and XGBoost along with genetic algorithm to improve the performance of IDS. The novel attacks detected in this phase are converted into signatures and exchanged further through the network using the blockchain framework in the second phase. This phase uses the cryptosystem as part of the blockchain to store data and secure it at a higher level. The blockchain is implemented using the Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 and v2.0, to create a prototype for secure signature transfer. It exchanges signatures in a much more secured manner using the blockchain architecture when implemented with version 2.0 of Hyperledger Fabric. The performance of the proposed blockchain system is evaluated on UNSW NB15 dataset. Blockchain performance has been evaluated in terms of execution time, average latency, throughput and transaction processing time. Experimental evidence of the proposed IDS system demonstrates improved performance with accuracy, detection rate and false alarm rate (FAR) as key parameters used. Accuracy and detection rate increase by 2% and 3% respectively whereas FAR reduces by 1.7%. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

Unfortunately, the spoofing attack, a kind of cyber-risk, has increased the number of cyber-criminals in data transfer applications without being detected, especially in smart cities. Several applications based on online video communications, such as online testing and video conferences, are involved in smart cities. The video displays various variations of a person, which makes face recognition an important concept in security implementation. The face spoofing attacks are mainly based on the person's face replication by replaying a video or by printed photos. Therefore, video forgery detection and related spoof attack detection have become a new topic in cybersecurity research. From this perspective, this paper presents a deep learning approach for video face forensic detection with a cyber facial spoofing attack using two methodologies. The first methodology is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the input video frames. The model has five convolutional layers followed by five pooling layers. The second methodology is based on convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM). This model comprises two pooling layers, two convolutional layers, and a convolutional LSTM layer. Each methodology includes a fully-connected layer to interconnect between the feature map resulting from the feature extraction process and the classification layer. A SoftMax layer performs the classification task in each method. This paper aims to achieve an optimum modality for face forensic detection to overcome spoofing attacks. Simulation results reveal that the ConvLSTM with CNN methodology achieves better classification results as the extracted features are more comprehensive than those of other conventional approaches. Also, it achieves an accuracy of 99%, and the works presented in the literature achieve an accuracy levels up to 95%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Cloud; CNN; ConvLSTM; Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Forensics detection; Forgery detection; IoT; Spoof attacks","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data transfer; Deep learning; Face recognition; Facsimile; Image coding; Image communication systems; Internet of things; Long short-term memory; Security of data; Smart city; Web services; Classification results; Classification tasks; Conventional approach; Forensic detection; Internet of Things (IOT); Recent researches; Security implementations; Video transmissions; Digital forensics",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114382217

However, in addition to the existing threats, the cloud computing environment faces various security issues in detecting anomalous network behaviors. In order to resolve the security issues, an effective intrusion detection system named Chronological Salp Swarm Algorithm-based Deep Belief Network is proposed for detecting the suspicious intrusions in a cloud environment. Accordingly, the proposed Chronological Salp Swarm Algorithm-based Deep Belief Network is developed by integrating the Chronological concept with the Salp Swarm Algorithm. The optimal solution for detecting the intrusion is revealed using the fitness function, which accepts the minimal error vale as the optimum solution. Here, the weights are optimally tuned by the proposed algorithm to generate an effective and optimal solution for detecting the intruders. The proposed Chronological Salp Swarm Algorithm-based Deep Belief Network obtained better performance through the facility of exploitation and the exploration in search space.

For example, an excessive traffic load sent to a web server for making it unusable is the main technique introduced by the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. A well-known method for detecting attacks consists in analyzing the sequence of source IP addresses for detecting possible anomalies. With the aim of predicting the next IP address, the Probability Density Function of the IP address sequence is estimated. Anomalous requests are detected via predicting source’s IP addresses in future accesses to the server. Thus, when an access to the server occurs, the server accepts only the requests from the predicted IP addresses and it blocks all the others. The approaches used to estimate the Probability Density Function of IP addresses range from the sequence of IP addresses seen previously and stored in a database to address clustering, for instance via the K-Means algorithm. Instead, the sequence of IP addresses is considered as a numerical sequence in this paper, and non-linear analysis of this numerical sequence is applied. In particular, we exploited non-linear analysis based on Volterra Kernels and Hammerstein models. The experiments carried out with datasets of source IP address sequences show that the prediction errors obtained with Hammerstein models are smaller than those obtained both with the Volterra Kernels and with the sequence clustering based on the K-Means algorithm. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cyber-attack; Distributed Denial of Service; Hammerstein models","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Data Analytics; Denial-of-service attack; Forecasting; K-means clustering; Network security; Probability density function; Detecting attacks; Distributed denial of service attack; Hammerstein model; Non-linear predictions; Numerical sequence; Prediction errors; Sequence clustering; Volterra kernels; Internet protocols",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114169079

These games are being used to aid administrative decisions in telecommunications and computational systems. Stackelberg games have increasingly been helpful in systems where security is a key decision consideration. The authors have suggested a cooperative and novel framework for selection of relays within Cognitive Radio (CR) System utilizing Stackelberg game-theoretic approach through this correspondence. The cooperation is based on the trustworthiness of the Secondary Users (SUs) while getting selected as a relay. Additionally, the strategy of the Secondary Transmitter (ST) is always to increase its own utility function by selecting the best available SU (as a relay) satisfying the rules of the Stackelberg game. The Nash equilibrium strategies for Secondary Relays (SR) have been analyzed in this paper at the suggested approach, as well as the Stackelberg competitive game with successive moves has been justified in the process. To our experience, no work on the trustworthy selection process of the relay to aid transmission of secondary users in the CR network using the game-theoretic method by Stackelberg has yet been published. Results obtained from simulation confirm that ST, as well as SR, gain more utilities if compared with the non-cooperative transmission scheme. Further, the relay which gets selected in this process even reduces the secondary outage loss in comparison to few non-game-theoretic approaches. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","CR networks; Game theory; Nash equilibrium; Relay selection; Stackelberg game","Cognitive radio; Network security; Competitive games; Computational system; Cooperative strategy; Nash equilibrium strategies; Non-cooperative; Relay selection; Stackelberg Games; Utility functions; Game theory",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114146556

Prior works of tackling ℓ0 attacks can neither eliminate perturbed pixels nor improve the performance of the classifier in the recovered low-quality images. To address the issue, we propose a novel method, called space transformation pixel defender (STPD), to transform any image into a latent space to separate the perturbed pixels from the normal pixels. In particular, this strategy uses a set of one-class classifiers, including Isolation Forest and Elliptic Envelope, to locate the perturbed pixels from adversarial examples. The value of the neighboring normal pixels is then used to replace the perturbed pixels, which hold more than half of the votes from these one-class classifiers.

Although regular defenses including firewall and IDS are deployed, they may be weakened by zero-day vulnerabilities and sophisticated attack schemes. Therefore, defense strategies to mitigate the risk of blackouts during cyber attacks are necessary. This paper proposes a cyber-physical coordinated defense strategy to overcome the disruption and minimize the risk as much as possible. At the cyber layer, a zero-sum multilevel Markovian Stackelberg game is proposed to model sequential actions of the attacker and the defender. The defender distributes defensive resources to protect lines in a real-time manner, according to the attacker's action. If cyber attacks should result in physical outages, defense at the physical layer is then employed. A security-constrained optimal power flow reserving security margin of critical components will be performed to minimize the blackout scale and potential future risk. To solve the corresponding optimization problem and further get the optimal defense strategy, this paper devises a novel 'water-pouring' algorithm. Lastly, test results show that the proposed dynamic defense strategy mitigates risk significantly and outperforms existing methods. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","Cyber attack; cyber-physical power system; game theory; risk mitigation; smart grid; Stackelberg game","Crime; Cyber Physical System; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Network security; Outages; Smart power grids; Critical component; Defense strategy; Optimization problems; Risk mitigation; Security margins; Security-constrained optimal power flow; Stackelberg Games; Zero day vulnerabilities; Computer crime",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112477961

Herein, we proposed a novel text-mining based cyber-risk assessment and mitigation framework, which performs the following critical tasks. (i) Cyber-risk Assessment - to identify hacker expertise (i.e., newbie, beginner, intermediate, and advanced) using explicit and implicit features applying various classification algorithms. Among these features, cybersecurity keywords, sharing of attachments, and sentiments emerged as significant. Further, we found that expert hackers demonstrate leadership in the online forums that eventually serve as communities of practice. Consequently, novice hackers gradually develop their cyber-attack skills through prolonged observations, interactions, and external influences in this social learning process. (ii) Cyber-risk mitigation – computes financial impact for every {hacker expertise, attack-type} combination, and then by ranking them on a {likelihood, impact} decision-matrix to prioritize mitigation strategies in affected organizations.

However, due to the increased complexity of the CPS, cyber-attacks nowadays are more sophisticated and less predictable, which makes risk management task more challenging. This paper aims for an effective cybersecurity risk management (CSRM) practice using assets criticality, predication of risk types and evaluating the effectiveness of existing controls. We follow a number of techniques for the proposed unified approach including fuzzy set theory for the asset criticality, machine learning classifiers for the risk predication and comprehensive assessment model (CAM) for evaluating the effectiveness of the existing controls. The proposed approach considers relevant CSRM concepts such as asset, threat actor, attack pattern, tactic, technique and procedure (TTP), and controls and maps these concepts with the VERIS community dataset (VCDB) features for the risk predication. The experimental results reveal that using the fuzzy set theory in assessing assets criticality supports stakeholder for an effective risk management practice.

However, how to efficiently defend against LFAs in IoT still remains as an open problem. To overcome this challenge, we model the interaction between an LFA attacker and the network manager as a two-person Bayesian game in this article to precisely characterize the behaviors of both sides. Then, the rational behaviors of the attacker and the optimal strategies of the defender are unveiled by deriving the Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE). Inspired by the obtained BNEs, a cost-effective decision framework is proposed for the defender to make defense decisions. Furthermore, we numerically analyze the effect of all the related factors and present feasible suggestions to deter attack motivations fundamentally. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of the defender's utilities under different attack intensities, but also is robust to the changes in important parameters, including the value of benign traffic and the latency of traffic scrubbing. © 2014 IEEE.","Bayesian game; defense decision-making; Internet of Things (IoT); link flooding attack (LFA)","Cost effectiveness; Denial-of-service attack; Floods; Game theory; Network security; Bayesian Nash equilibria; Cost effective decision; Different attacks; Distributed denial of service attack; Internet of Things (IOT); Massive deployment; Optimal strategies; Rational behavior; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112240253

More critically, a false data injection attack could influence both accuracy of state estimates and the evaluation of system dynamics. Typically, false data sequences are modeled as multi-constraint non-linear optimization with random, step, or ramp type distribution. However, a carefully designed attack that mimics the dynamic response of a natural disturbance can hugely impact trends-based applications of synchrophasor-based disturbance monitoring and mode metering. This work designs a multi-channel/multi-sample dynamic injection attack in phasor trends to closely mimic natural disturbances aiming at trends-based applications. Also, the work proposes an un-supervised wavelet probability mapping method for the detection and correction of dynamic false data sequences.

Among those, a big challenge is how to keep all of the devices accessible everywhere and every time. In the IoT network, the assumption is that each IoT device can be reached by any client at any given time. In practice, this is not always possible and without a proper mechanism the nodes behind a NAT are unable to communicate with each other directly, and their addresses have to be shared through a trusted third party. This challenge becomes harder by taking into consideration that most NAT traversal approaches have been developed prior to rising of the IoT, without taking into account the constrained nature of the participating devices and mostly depend on a centralized entity. In this paper we proposed the Distributed Address Table (DAT), a decentralized, secure and lightweight address distribution model that allows any two nodes to get the addresses of the other end without relying on a trusted third party. Structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay by utilizing Distributed Hash Table (DHT) technique is generated as its underlying communication scheme to ensure that all participating devices are accessible at any given time. This is achieved through simple, yet secure and efficient decentralized model. The DAT adopts the edge/fog computing paradigms to ensure a decentralized address distribution.

However, the presence of rogue IoT devices has exposed the IoT to untold risks with severe consequences. The first step in securing the IoT is detecting rogue IoT devices and identifying legitimate ones. Conventional approaches use cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate and verify legitimate devices' identities. However, cryptographic protocols are not available in many systems. Meanwhile, these methods are less effective when legitimate devices can be exploited or encryption keys are disclosed. Therefore, noncryptographic IoT-device identification and rogue device detection become efficient solutions to secure existing systems and will provide additional protection to systems with cryptographic protocols. Noncryptographic approaches require more effort and are not yet adequately investigated. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on machine learning technologies for the identification of IoT devices along with the detection of compromised or falsified ones from the viewpoint of passive surveillance agents or network operators.

In order to address this issue, we present the minimization problem of the secrecy outage probability (SOP), by jointly taking into account the constraints from the latency and energy consumption. With the aim to improve the system secrecy performance, we then introduce three user selection criteria to choose the best user among multiple ones.

Edge computing is an emerging solution to gain business value of IoT services where real-time demands become satisfied by moving computing resources close to data sources. Nevertheless, edge resources are still limited to be able to fulfill all demands at the same time. Among new approaches, resource sharing between edge/cloud service providers has been considered as a promising mechanism to address resource scarcity and pursue cost reduction. In this article, we propose an allocation and sharing model in the edge cloud network where providers team up to efficiently utilize resources, named the share-to-run IoT services (SRIS). In particular, we formulate a resource allocation and sharing optimization model to implement IoT services of multiple edge/cloud providers that can maximize the providers' utility while satisfying service constraints. We relax SRIS into a tractable form that can be solved efficiently using well-known distributed convex frameworks, such as the dual decomposition and alternating direction method of multipliers. Finally, we evaluate our methods by providing several simulation cases, in which our proposed mechanisms show outstanding outcomes by obtaining a faster convergence, increasing by 6.9% of utilization, and 16% of acceptance rate compared to the nonoptimal approach. © 2014 IEEE.","Cloud; edge computing; Internet of Things (IoT); resource allocation; resource sharing","Cost reduction; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Computing resource; Exponential growth; Faster convergence; Internet of thing (IOT); Optimal approaches; Optimization modeling; Service constraints; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107372253

At the planning stage, the defender can utilize software diversity, which is a common phenomenon that the cyber software of different substations comes from different competing vendors. Therefore, different kinds of software may not be exposed to the same zero-day security loophole, preventing the attacker from taking charge of multiple substations at the same time. In this paper, the optimal scheme of software deployment considering long-term risk mitigation is studied. Firstly, the framework of diversity-based cyber defense against malicious attacks is formulated. Secondly, the risk index based on representative attack patterns is constructed, which is the objective to be minimized. Thirdly, considering that the deployment scheme is long-term stable while the operating mode varies with time, we construct a multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming to mitigate the average risk of operating modes.

Modern vehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything technologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles, infrastructures, and smart devices. However, the improving functionality and connectivity of modern vehicles also increase their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks targeting both intravehicle and external networks due to the large attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have focused on developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on machine learning methods to detect malicious cyber-attacks. In this article, the vulnerabilities of intravehicle and external networks are discussed, and a multitiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an anomaly-based IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on vehicular networks. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed system can detect various types of known attacks with 99.99% accuracy on the CAN-intrusion-dataset representing the IVN data and 99.88% accuracy on the CICIDS2017 data set illustrating the external vehicular network data.

However, the data aggregation function will compromise the privacy of device data. In this article, we proposed an efficient privacy-preserving multidimensional data aggregation scheme for IoT, called PMDA. The scheme uses the Chinese remainder theorem to design a homomorphic encryption method that encryptes a multiple-dimensional small integer vector into one ciphertext and keeps linear homomorphic properties per dimension. Combining with the signature mechanism and the batch verification method, the scheme guarantees nonrepudiation of device data and enhance verification efficiency at edge nodes. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve correctness, privacy, authentication, and integrity. After performance evaluation, we demonstrate that our scheme is superior to other schemes in terms of computation and communication costs.

We uncover mainly unprotected inter-domain ICS traffic and provide an in-depth view on Internet-wide ICS communication. Our results can be used (i) to create precise filters for potentially harmful non-industrial ICS traffic and (ii) to detect ICS sending unprotected inter-domain ICS traffic, being vulnerable to eavesdropping and traffic manipulation attacks. Additionally, we survey recent security extensions of ICS protocols, of which we find very little deployment. We estimate an upper bound of the deployment status for ICS security protocols in the Internet core. © 2021 The Authors.

The PMU communication network is, generally, a public wide area network, hence it is vulnerable to cyberattacks. At present, IEEE C37.118.2 is widely used as the communication standard for PMU communication. However, the IEEE C37.118.2 standard does not specify any security mechanism to protect the PMU data from cyberattacks. Deviation in the transmitted data of PMUs may lead to devastating consequences, such as blackouts in the grid. To mitigate cyberattacks on a PMU, this article proposes a security mechanism based on key distribution scheme that ensures integrity along with confidentiality. This mechanism involves addition of new security fields to IEEE C37.118.2 message structure. The introduction of security mechanism imposes additional computational complexity on resource constraint PMU devices and addition of new security fields in PMU message structure increases overall message size which in turn increases communication delays. In order to assess the additional computational complexity and increased communication delays, an experimental set up consisting of PMU simulators and network emulator is developed in this article.

These issues need to be carefully addressed due to the sensitive data within IoT systems. However, some IoT devices have various limitations in terms of energy, memory capacity, and computational resources, which makes them extremely vulnerable to security attacks. Data integrity with source authentication are essential security services for protecting IoT data value and utility. Existing message authentication algorithms (MAAs), which are either based on block ciphers or keyed hash functions, require multiple rounds and complex operations, which leads to unacceptable overhead for resource-limited devices and delay-sensitive applications. Moreover, the high number of IoT connected devices generates a huge amount of data, which challenges even the capacity of powerful network devices to handle the security of such Big Data. As such, the protection of such amounts of generated data calls for lightweight security solutions. In this paper, we propose a lightweight MAA that provides data integrity and source authentication. The proposed solution is based on a dynamic key structure with a single round and simple operations. The used cryptographic primitives (substitution and permutation tables) are dynamic and get updated for each new input message by using specific update primitives. The dynamic structure of the proposed MAA allows for decreasing the required number of rounds to just one, while maintaining a high degree of security. The security tests results show that the proposed keyed hash functions (1) achieve the desired cryptographic properties, (2) are immune against existing attacks and (3) require low overhead in terms of computational and storage resources. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Dynamic key-dependent cryptography; Lightweight message authentication algorithm; Security and performance analysis","Authentication; Digital storage; Hash functions; Privacy by design; Public key cryptography; Computational resources; Cryptographic primitives; Cryptographic properties; Delay-sensitive applications; Internet of thing (IOT); Lightweight securities; Message authentication algorithms; Resource-limited devices; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099951018

Due to their importance, social networks must be trustworthy and secure, so that their shared information can be used by the people without any concerns, and must be protected against possible attacks and misuses. One of the most critical attacks against the reputation system is represented by mendacious reviews. As this kind of attacks can be conducted by legitimate users of the network, a particularly powerful solution is to exploit trust management, by assigning a trust degree to users, so that people can weigh the gathered data based on such trust degrees. Trust management within the context of SRSs is particularly challenging, as determining incorrect behaviors is subjective and hard to be fully automatized. Several attempts in the current literature have been proposed; however, such an issue is still far from been completely resolved.

The algorithm produces the least number of vulnerabilities, the removal of which protects the targets.

As rates of data usage and internet consumption continue to increase, cyber awareness turned to be increasingly urgent. This study focuses on the relationships between cyber security awareness, knowledge and behavior with protection tools among individuals in general and across four countries: Israel, Slovenia, Poland and Turkey in particular. Results show that internet users possess adequate cyber threat awareness but apply only minimal protective measures usually relatively common and simple ones. The study findings also show that higher cyber knowledge is connected to the level of cyber awareness, beyond the differences in respondent country or gender. In addition, awareness is also connected to protection tools, but not to information they were willing to disclose. Lastly, findings exhibit differences between the explored countries that affect the interaction between awareness, knowledge, and behaviors. Results, implications, and recommendations for effective based cyber security training programs are presented and discussed. © 2020 International Association for Computer Information Systems.","cyber awareness; cyber behavior; cyber knowledge; Cyber security; cyber threats","Computer science; Computers; Information systems; cyber awareness; Cyber behaviors; cyber knowledge; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Network security",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079386211

The Continuous Snapshots can reduce the data loss in case of failures and thus is prevailing for protecting long-running systems. However, existing methods suffer from long VM downtime, long snapshot interval and significant performance loss. In this article, we present iConSnap, a system designed to take fine-grained continuous snapshots of virtual machines without compromising VM performance. First, iConSnap adopts the copy-on-write (COW) mechanism to save the memory pages on-demand, and thus decreases the VM downtime to about 200 milliseconds. Second, we extend the idea of COW and propose a lazily incremental approach to save the delta data between two successive snapshots only once, thereby reducing the snapshot duration and snapshot data a lot. Third, we propose a scheduling mechanism to mitigate the VM performance penalty issue. Last, we introduce a method combined of compression and time-aware multi-granularity reclamation strategy to reduce the storage costs without losing performance and availability. We implement iConSnap on QEμKVM and evaluate it through a set of experiments. The experimental results show that iConSnap outperforms existing approaches in terms of VM downtime, snapshot duration, storage costs and VM performance. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","continuous snapshots; copy-on-write; memory saving; space reclamation; Virtual machine","Cloud computing; Data reduction; Digital storage; Maintenance; Network security; Optimization; Reliability; Virtualization; Continuous Snapshots; Copy on write; Cows; Memory savings; Runtimes; Virtual machining; Virtual machine",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075955875

However, recent breakthrough results on quantum computers indicate that applying quantum computers in clouds would be realized. A majority of existing public verification schemes are based on conventional hardness assumptions, which are vulnerable to adversaries equipped with quantum computers in the near future. Moreover, new security issues need to be solved when an original data owner is restricted or cannot access the remote cloud server flexibly. In this paper, we propose an efficient identity-based data outsourcing with public integrity verification scheme (DOPIV) in cloud storage. DOPIV is designed on lattice-based cryptography, which achieves post-quantum security. DOPIV enables an original data owner to delegate a proxy to generate the signatures of data and outsource them to the cloud server. Any TPA can perform data integrity verification efficiently on behalf of the original data owner, without retrieving the entire data set. Additionally, DOPIV possesses the advantages of being identity-based systems, avoiding complex certificate management procedures. We provide security proofs of DOPIV in the random oracle model, and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation to show that DOPIV is more practical in post-quantum secure cloud storage systems. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Cloud storage; identity-based data outsourcing; lattice-based cryptography; post-quantum security; public verification","Cloud computing; Computers; Cryptography; Network security; Outsourcing; Quantum cryptography; Qubits; Servers; Cloud storages; Data integrity; Data outsourcing; Lattice-based cryptography; Post-quantum securities; Public verifications; Digital storage",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072723449
