Publish-subscribe systems enable IoT devices to communicate with the cloud platform. However, IoT applications need context-aware messages to translate the data into contextual information, allowing the applications to act cognitively. Besides, end-to-end security of publish-subscribe messages on both ends (devices and cloud) is essential. However, achieving security on constrained IoT devices with memory, payload, and energy restrictions is a challenge. Contribution: Messages in IoT need to achieve both energy efficiency and secure delivery. Thus, the main contribution of this paper refers to a performance evaluation of a message structure that standardizes the publish-subscribe topic and payload used by the cloud platform and the IoT devices. We also propose a standardization for the topic and payload for publish-subscribe systems. Conclusion: The messages promote energy efficiency, enabling ultra-low-power and high-capacity devices and reducing the bytes transmitted in the IoT domain. The performance evaluation demonstrates that publish-subscribe systems (namely, AMQP, DDS, and MQTT) can use our proposed energy-efficient message structure on IoT. Additionally, the message system provides end-to-end confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity between IoT devices and the cloud platform. © 2022, The Author(s).","Context-aware messages; IoT; Publish-subscribe; Security; WSN","Energy efficiency; Publishing; Cloud platforms; Context-Aware; Context-aware message; Energy efficient; Message structures; Performances evaluation; Publish/subscribe; Publish/Subscribe system; Security; WSN; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124020270

An informationally structured environment is vital for developing intelligent service robots by embedding various sensors in the environment to enhance the sensing capability and intelligence of robots. Thus far, we have been developing a software platform, named ROS-TMS, for an informationally structured environment, which connects various sensors and robots using ROS architecture. In recent years, ROS2, a next-generation version of ROS, has been released. ROS2 has many advantages, such as enhanced security, QoS control, and support for various platforms. ROS2-TMS, a new version of ROS-TMS, is developed not only by porting existing modules in ROS-TMS, such as the control system for a communication robot, but also by adding useful functions utilizing new features in ROS2. For instance, we added a voice user interface to control robots and various devices in the environment, such as lights or a bed. In addition, we implemented a new task scheduler that provides a cancelation function to stop running tasks and improve the security of the platform. © 2022, The Author(s).","Ambient sensing; Cyber physical system; Informationally structured environment; Internet of things; Service robot","Embedded systems; Intelligent robots; Internet of things; Mobile robots; User interfaces; Ambient sensing; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Embeddings; Informationally structured environment; Intelligent Service robots; QoS support; Service robots; Software platforms; Structured environment; Cyber Physical System",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124008424

The reason for this trend is that integration internet of things (IoT) features into medical devices greatly improve the quality and effectiveness of service. However, there are many unsolved security problems. Due to medical information is critical and important, authentication between users and medical servers is an essential issue. Recently, Park et al. proposed an authentication scheme using Shamir’s threshold technique for IoT-based medical information system and claimed that their scheme satisfies all security requirements and is immune to various types of attacks. However, in this paper, we show that Park et al.’s scheme does not achieve user anonymity, forward security, and mutual authentication and it is not resistant to the DoS attacks and then we introduce an improved mutual authentication scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and Shamir’s secret sharing for IoT-based medical information system. In this paper, we formally analyze the security properties of our scheme via the ProVerif.

Such a platform can enable the expansion of IoT for environmental and lifestyle applications. Here we report a platform capable of acquiring currents ranging from 1.5 nA to 7.2 µA full-scale with 20-bit resolution and variable sampling rates of up to 3.125 kSPS. In addition, it features a bipolar voltage programmable in the range of −10 V to +5 V with a 3.65 mV resolution. A Finite State Machine steers the system by executing a set of embedded functions. The FSM allows for dynamic, customized adjustments of the nanosensor bias, including elevated bias schemes for self-heating, measurement range, bandwidth, sampling rate, and measurement time intervals. Furthermore, it enables data logging on external memory (SD card) and data transmission over a Bluetooth low energy connection. The average power consumption of the platform is 64.5 mW for a measurement protocol of three samples per second, including a BLE advertisement of a 0 dBm transmission power. A state-of-the-art (SoA) application of the platform performance using a CNT nanosensor, exposed to NO2 gas concentrations from 200 ppb down to 1 ppb, has been demonstrated. Although sensor signals are measured for NO2 concentrations of 1 ppb, the 3σ limit of detection (LOD) of 23 ppb is determined (1σ: 7 ppb) in slope detection mode, including the sensor signal variations in repeated measurements. The platform’s wide current range and high versatility make it suitable for signal acquisition from resistive nanosensors such as silicon nanowires, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and other 2D materials. Along with its overall low power consumption, the proposed platform is highly suitable for various sensing applications within the context of IoT. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"Carbon nanotubes; Electric power utilization; Internet of things; Nitrogen oxides; Signal processing; Customizable; Embedded sensing; High sensitivity; Low power wireless; Nanoscale sensors; Physical parameters; Sensing platforms; Sensor signals; Spatiotemporal measurement; Wireless platform; Nanosensors",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123085671

Several solutions have been proposed in various communication domains which could be classified into two categories: (1) directory based, and (2) directory-less. The former is efficient but suffers from the amount of control messages being exchanged to maintain all directories in an agile environment. However, the latter approach attempts to reduce the amount of control messages to update directories, by simply sending broadcast messages to discover services; which is also a non-desirable approach in MANETs. This research work builds on top of our prior work (Nazeeruddin et al. in IFIP/IEEE international conference on management of multimedia networks and services, Springer, Berlin, 2006)) where we introduced a new efficient protocol for service discovery in MANETs (MSLD); a lightweight, robust, scalable, and flexible protocol which supports node heterogeneity and dynamically adapts to network changes while not flooding the network with extra protocol messages—a major challenge in today’s network environments, such as Internet of Things (IoT). Extensive simulations study was conducted on MSLD to: (1) initially evaluate its performance in terms of latency, service availability, and overhead messages, then (2) compare its performance to Dir-Based, Dir-less, and PDP protocols under various network conditions. For most performance metrics, simulation results show that MSLD outperforms Dir-Based, Dir-less, and PDP by either matching or achieving high service availability, low service discovery latency, and considerably less communication overhead. © 2021, The Author(s).","Auto-configuration; Distributed directory-based approach; Mobile Ad hoc networks; Service discovery protocol","Internet of things; Internet protocols; Multimedia services; Auto-configuration; Control messages; Discovery protocol; Distributed directory-based approach; Mobile ad-hoc networks; Performance; Performances evaluation; Service discovery; Service discovery protocol; Services availability; Mobile ad hoc networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122703343

A solution approach is to leverage cloud resources for storing blocks within the chain. The paper, therefore, proposes two solutions to this problem. The first being an improved hybrid architecture design which uses containerization to create a side chain on a fog node for the devices connected to it and an Advanced Time-variant Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (AT-MOPSO) for determining the optimal number of blocks that should be transferred to the cloud for storage. This algorithm uses time-variant weights for the velocity of the particle swarm optimization and the non-dominated sorting and mutation schemes from NSGA-III. The proposed algorithm was compared with results from the original MOPSO algorithm, the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA-II), and the Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm with region-based selection (PESA-II), and NSGA-III. The proposed AT-MOPSO showed better results than the aforementioned MOPSO algorithms in cloud storage cost and query probability optimization. Importantly, AT-MOPSO achieved 52% energy efficiency compared to NSGA-III. To show how this algorithm can be applied to a real-world Blockchain system, the BISS industrial Blockchain architecture was adapted and modified to show how the AT-MOPSO can be used with existing Blockchain systems and the benefits it provides. © 2021, The Author(s).","Blockchain; Cloud storage; Internet of Things; Particle swarm optimization; Scalability","Blockchain; Energy efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Internet of things; Multiobjective optimization; Screening; Architecture designs; Block-chain; Cloud storages; Hybrid architectures; Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms; Side-chains; Solution approach; Storage optimization; Storage requirements; Time variant; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122333565

The controlled parameter is the total amount of occupied system resources for all active sessions subject system interaction. Based on the created model, the metric of parameters that fully characterize the quality of functioning of the studied IoT system is analytically described. The proposed metric includes such stochastic characteristic parameters as the average number of active sessions of subject-system interaction in the information environment of the IoT system, the average amount of occupied system resources, and the probability of losing incoming requests due to insufficient free system resources or lack of free communication channels. The dependence of the mentioned stochastic characteristic parameters on the type and settings of the distribution function of the released system resources volume is also analytically formalized.

In particular, for the studied system with an increase in load in the range from 0.8 to 1.1: - the average number of active sessions of subject-system interaction increased linearly from 11 to 16; - the average amount of occupied system resources gradually increased nonlinearly from 72% to 93%; - the probability of losing an incoming request increased exponentially from 5% to 18%. Note that the increase in the value of the probability of loss of incoming requests is exponential. It is established that the reason for such growth is the growth of variance of the main characteristic parameter of incoming requests – the value of the desired amount of system resources. The geometric distribution-based system resource management scheme also found that it mainly satisfies incoming requests with a smaller value of the desired amount of system resources and, in general, is focused on supporting already active sessions of subject-system interaction. The proposed mathematical apparatus can be used at the design stage of client-oriented 4G-LTE, 5G, and, potentially, 6G ecosystems. © 2022","5G-IoT ecosystem; Availability; discrete Markov chain; Quality metric; Subject-system interaction session","Availability; Distribution functions; Ecosystems; Internet of things; Markov processes; Parameter estimation; Quality control; Stochastic systems; 5g-IoT ecosystem; Average numbers; Characteristics parameters; Discrete markov chain; Front end; Quality metrices; Stochastic characteristic; Subject-system interaction session; System interactions; System resources; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123838122

For example, in agriculture, this type of technology has supported the monitoring of environmental variables essential in decision-making, defining when and how much water to use in a given crop. Besides, it made it possible to control various devices to meet each crop type's environmental requirements, increasing productivity. In this sense, there is a need for increasingly improved control strategies to meet crop requirements in real-time, ensuring sustainable production and reliable quality. This work presents Discrete Event System techniques to develop an agricultural greenhouse controller considering self-configuring mechanisms for adapting to dynamic environments and preventing conflicting rules from violating control objectives.

We used accurate climate data from actual Brazilian meteorological stations to evaluate different control scenarios in the year's four seasons, checking the controller's efficiency and the control strategy adopted, guaranteeing the crop's thermal comfort and minimizing water loss.

However, placing cloudlets in a highly heterogeneous deployment scenario considering the next-generation 5G networks and IoT applications is still an open challenge. The novel requirements of these applications indicate that there is still a gap in ensuring low-latency service guarantees when deploying cloudlets. Furthermore, deploying cloudlets in a cost-effective manner and ensuring full coverage for all users in edge computing are other critical conflicting issues. In this article, we address these issues by designing a bifactor approximation algorithm to solve the heterogeneous cloudlet placement problem to guarantee a bounded latency and placement cost, while fully mapping user applications to appropriate cloudlets. We first formulate the problem as a multi-objective integer programming model and show that it is a computationally NP-hard problem.

We investigate the effectiveness of ACP by performing extensive theoretical analysis and experiments on multiple deployment scenarios based on New York City OpenData.

Blockchain is a database used for decentralized transaction purposes. It provides novel directions to store and manage data, whereas IoT relates to the propagation of linked machines by providing information through the Internet. A mixture of Blockchain and the IoT appears hopeful, even though blockchain requires real-time data application, and IoT describes processes to store and manage information overloads safely and proficiently. The technology is significant to the manufacturing business, experiencing a digital revolution by incorporating equipment, developments, and data, leading to the Industrial IoT (IIoT). Such a combination of IIoT and blockchain is termed Blockchain for Industrial Internet of Things (BIIoT). The paper gives a detailed survey on BIIoT and discusses all relevant aspects of this novel concept. Firstly, IoT as a concept has been explored briefly, and relevant threats to IoT has been investigated. Furthermore, the domain of IIoT and the relevant challenges to IIoT is discussed. Additionally, an overview of blockchain technology is presented. Subsequently, a combination of IIoT and blockchain is explored, and the BIIoT structural design proposal is submitted. Finally, issues related to the use of IIoT with blockchain for industrial applications of BIIoT is explored. Thus, all relevant open research directions in Blockchain and IIoT are summarized in this paper. This survey shows that the proposed BIIoT is used to develop a redundant, traceable, and secure complex interconnected IIoT environment.

In this paper we propose a light-harvesting self-powered mechanical sensing concept with a simple monolithic structure. We successfully demonstrate the excellent operation of our sensors under different photoexcitation conditions from natural to artificial lights and from weak to strong light powers. Under illumination of a commercial light emitting diode (LED) with a power of 46 µW, the generated lateral photovoltage is of 3.07 mV, which increases by 6, 13, and 20 µV under applied strains of 225, 450, and 675 ppm, respectively. Upon the increase of the light power to 428 µW, the lateral photovoltage reaches 16.42 mV under the free-strain condition, and increases by 11, 25, and 45 µV under the same strain conditions. In addition, even under room light, the lateral photovoltages are 0.86 mV, 0.86 mV + 4.2 µV, 0.86 mV + 8.0 µV, and 0.86 mV + 11.5 µV under strains of 0, 225, 450, and 675 ppm, respectively. Interestingly, the sensitivity of the sensor increases from 0.017 µV/ppm under ambient lighting to 0.03 and 0.065 µV/ppm under LED light powers of 46 µW and 428 µW, respectively. These promising results indicate that sensitivity of the self-powered strain sensor can be readily tuned by controlling illumination.

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose SG-PBFT (Score Grouping-PBFT), a secure and efficient distributed consensus algorithm for blockchain applications in the IoV. The distributed structure can reduce the pressure on the central server and decrease the risk of single-node attacks. The SG-PBFT consensus algorithm improves the traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm by optimizing the PBFT consensus process and using a score grouping mechanism to achieve a higher consensus efficiency. The experimental results show that the method can greatly improve the consistency efficiency and effectively prevent single-node attacks. Specifically, when the number of consensus nodes reaches 1000, the consensus time of our algorithm is only about 27% of what is required for the state-of-the-art PBFT consensus algorithm.

Despite various solutions, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)’s Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is one of the preferred techniques in the literature. In this model, users who satisfy access policies using both static and dynamic attributes are allowed to access the data. However, NIST's ABAC model does not support encryption and therefore does not satisfy data confidentiality. Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a known cryptographic primitive that enables fine-grained access control over encrypted data. However, currently the existing ABE schemes do not meet NIST's ABAC requirements or are not computationally efficient enough for IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Security ABAC (MLS-ABAC) scheme that satisfies the requirements of NIST's ABAC model. Our construction is efficient and relies on a decryption outsourceable Ciphertext-Policy ABE scheme. Additionally, based on realistic application scenarios, only the authorized data users can decrypt the ciphertext, and check the integrity of the retrieved message. Furthermore, we present both conceptual and formal models for our proposed MLS-ABAC architecture along with performance metrics.

Sensitive data are collected and aggregated in a privacy-preserving approach using current Internet of Things (IoT) technology, leading to immense challenge and consequent interest in developing secure computing algorithms for individual and organizational data. However, most existing solutions focus on specific evaluations (e.g., SUM), and they use heavy cryptographic techniques, which are far from practice for constrained IoT devices. The Trusted Execution Environment (TEE, implemented with Intel SGX) can assist in computing arbitrary functions and avoiding resource-consuming operations. Nevertheless, TEE is subject to several challenges because TEE is vulnerable to limited resource and even function violations, e.g., the attacker may bypass the boundary of TEE. In this paper, we propose a lightweight non-interactive privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme for resource-constrained devices, named PANDA, where TEE is introduced to bypass the trusted entities requirement and heavy overhead. Additionally, PANDA explores the certificate-aided function authorization to prevent leakage from unauthorized functions, and designs the public verifiable certificate management to detect the abnormal behaviors of the host to mitigate the external host compromise. We formalize PANDA with rigorous security analysis to indicate privacy protection against the compromised aggregator and analyst.

As fog devices are distributed, heterogeneous and resource-constrained, efficient application scheduling mechanisms are required to harvest the full potential of such computing environments. Due to the rapid evolution in IoT ecosystems and also to better suit fog environment characteristics, IoT application development has moved from the monolithic architecture towards the microservices architecture that enhances scalability, maintainability and extensibility of the applications. This architecture improves the granularity of service decomposition, thus providing scope for improvement in QoS-aware placement policies. Existing application placement policies lack proper utilisation of these features of microservices architecture, thus failing to produce efficient placements. In this paper, we harvest the characteristics of microservice architecture to propose a scalable QoS-aware application scheduling policy for batch placement of microservices-based IoT applications within fog environments. Our proposed policy, QoS-aware Multi-objective Set-based Particle Swarm Optimisation (QMPSO), aims at maximising the satisfaction of multiple QoS parameters (makespan, budget and throughput) while focusing on the utilisation of limited fog resources. Besides, QMPSO adapts and improves the Set-based Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimisation (S-CLPSO) algorithm to achieve better convergence in the fog application placement problem. We evaluate our policy in a simulated fog environment. The results show that compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, our placement algorithm significantly improves QoS in terms of makespan satisfaction (up to 35% improvement) and budget satisfaction (up to 70% improvement) and ensures optimum usage of computing and network resources, thus providing a robust approach for QoS-aware placement of microservices-based heterogeneous applications within fog environments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Application placement; Fog computing; Internet of Things; Microservice applications; QoS-awareness","Budget control; Fog computing; Internet of things; Network architecture; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Scheduling; Application placements; Application scheduling; Computing capability; Computing environments; Computing paradigm; Makespan; Microservice application; Multi objective; QoS awareness; QoS-aware; Fog",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124011298

To realize the covert communication between the transmitter and the legitimate user, the detection error probability of the warden is firstly derived, and then the optimal detection threshold and the minimum detection error probability (MDEP) are obtained.

Although the relevant problems in communication and computation have been well studied in data center environments, few works have considered the issues in an Internet of Things (IoT) edge scenario. In fact, processing data in a load balancing way for the latter case is more challenging. The main reason is that, unlike a data center, both the data sources and the network infrastructure in an IoT edge system can be dynamic. Moreover, with different performance requirements from IoT networks and edge servers, it will be hard to characterize the performance model and to perform runtime optimization for the whole system. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose a load-balancing aware networking approach for efficient data processing in IoT edge systems.

Findings revealed that personal innovativeness, social influence, quality of service (QoS) and perceived trust are the significant determinants of use intention.

In this case, the previous intrusion detection methods have the problem of high false positive rates and low detection accuracy, which restricts the application of these methods in a real situation.

However, limited computing and processing capabilities of edge devices remains to be difficult to meet complex data processing and artificial intelligence (AI) analysis requirements for diverse services. Besides, the scarcity of wireless spectrum resources in harsh industrial environment makes the interference between devices more serious. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an adaptive distributed collaborative anti-interference optimization scheme for IoT-edge system. Firstly, the EC system model is established, and the model of link failure probability is derived theoretically. Then, an Occupy-Interference Mitigation (O-IM) algorithm based on full-frequency multiplexing is proposed. The algorithm combines adaptive full-frequency multiplexing and interference mitigation to reduce the dependence of the reliable collaboration on bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, an anti-interference algorithm based on Interference Mitigation and inter-cellfrequency multiplexing Interference Avoidance (IM-IA) is proposed to balance bandwidth and SNR. This algorithm adopts interference cancellation scheme in the broadcasting phase, and adopts orthogonal frequency division in the collaboration phase. Extensive simulation results on Mininet platform verify that the proposals can obtain lower failure probability, and are less than traditional solutions in transmitting power, bandwidth, and SNR requirements. Moreover, the O-IM is suitable for low power scenarios, while the IM-IA is more suitable for high power case. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Anti-interference; Collaborative communication; Distributed collaboration; Edge computing network; Spatial diversity","Bandwidth; Data handling; Internet of things; Outages; Real time systems; Signal to noise ratio; Simulation platform; Anti-interference; Collaborative communications; Computing system; Distributed collaboration; Edge computing; Edge computing network; Frequency multiplexing; Interference mitigation; Multiplexing interference; Spatial diversity; Edge computing",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124467007

The latency, cost, and other challenges in cloud-based IoT data processing have driven the adoption of Edge and Fog computing models, where some data processing tasks are moved closer to data sources. Properly dealing with the flow of such data requires building data pipelines, to control the complete life cycle of data streams from data acquisition at the data source, edge and fog processing, to Cloud side storage and analytics. Data analytics tasks need to be executed dynamically at different distances from the data sources and often on very heterogeneous hardware devices. This can be streamlined by the use of a Serverless (or FaaS) cloud computing model, where tasks are defined as virtual functions, which can be migrated from edge to cloud (and vice versa) and executed in an event-driven manner on data streams. In this work, we investigate the benefits of building Serverless data pipelines (SDP) for IoT data analytics and evaluate three different approaches for designing SDPs: (1) Off-the-shelf data flow tool (DFT) based, (2) Object storage service (OSS) based and (3) MQTT based. Further, we applied these strategies on three fog applications (Aeneas, PocketSphinx, and custom Video processing application) and evaluated the performance by comparing their processing time (computation time, network communication and disk access time), and resource utilization. Results show that DFT is unsuitable for compute-intensive applications such as video or image processing, whereas OSS is best suitable for this task. However, DFT is nicely fit for bandwidth-intensive applications due to the minimum use of network resources. On the other hand, MQTT-based SDP is observed with increase in CPU and Memory usage as the number of users rose, and experienced a drop in data units in the pipeline for PocketSphinx and custom video processing applications, however it performed well for Aeneas which had low size data units. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; Data pipelines; Edge computing; Fog computing; Internet of things; Serverless computing","Data acquisition; Data Analytics; Data handling; Digital storage; Edge computing; Fog; Image processing; Internet of things; Life cycle; Pipeline processing systems; Pipelines; Video signal processing; Cloud-computing; Computing model; Data analytics; Data pipelines; Data stream; Data-source; Dataflow; Edge computing; Object storages; Serverless computing; Fog computing",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124281484

This paper aims to design an intelligent routing system based on machine learning techniques, the use of which represents another possibility to classify bundles that have arrived at the destination successfully or not. These networks occasionally carry out an evaluation which makes it possible to choose the type of routing corresponding to a given situation. It then minimizes the unnecessary information of the entries and performs the classification of the data. Despite the problems cited, our challenge is to design an intelligent routing mechanism that is able to classify bundles that have arrived and those that have not arrived at their destination. The smart routing system uses machine learning as a main tool to design our system. Indeed, various Machine Learning techniques, such as Bagging and Boosting, have been used to classify whether bundles have arrived at their destination successfully or not. Machine Learning now enables us to learn directly from data rather than human expertise, resulting in higher accuracy.

In some scenarios, a large group of MTC devices (MTCDs) may enter the communication coverage of a new target base station simultaneously. However, the current handover mechanism specified by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 16 incurs high signaling overhead over the access network and the core network for such scenario. Moreover, other existing solutions have several security problems in terms of the failure of key forward secrecy (KFS) and lack of mutual authentication. In this paper, we propose an efficient authentication protocol for a group of MTCDs in all handover scenarios. By the proposal, the messages from two MTCDs are concatenated with an aggregated message authentication code (MAC) and sent by an authenticated group member to reduce the signaling cost. The proposed protocol has been formally evaluated by Scyther tool to prove its security. And it has been analysed on its security functionality to show its ability to resist major typical malicious attacks. Temporary identities of MTCDs have been used to preserve users’ privacy. It can be expected that the proposed protocol is applicable to all kinds of group mobility scenarios such as a platoon of vehicles or a high-speed train. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed protocol is efficient in terms of computational, communication, signaling, and energy cost. © 2021","5G; Group handover authentication; MTCD; Network security; Privacy-preserving","5G mobile communication systems; Authentication; Internet of things; Privacy-preserving techniques; Queueing networks; Railroad cars; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Authentication protocols; Communication device; Group handover; Group handover authentication; Handover authentications; Machinetype communication (MTC); MTC device; Networks security; Privacy preserving; Network security",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124186606

The difficulties faced by the PV prosumers include the intermittent nature of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), and PV prosumers who consume their own PV power face a power fluctuation problem. PV prosumer have one-time slot with excess PV power generation (power loss) and another slot with insufficient PV power generation (shortage). Moreover, sometimes, a total absence of PV power (affecting the prosumer day to day life). PV prosumers directly connect to the utility grid, resulting in moderate PV power selling prices, but PV prosumers purchase power from the utility grid at high prices at a time slot t. PV prosumers only earn the smallest profit under this plan. As a consequence, the DESP is proposed. SHM needs a DESP to manage the Battery Storage System (BSS) and minimize the PV prosumer electricity tariff using an internal pricing scheme to utilize RES efficiently.

In this paper, we mathematically formulate the task scheduling problem to minimize the total energy consumption of fog nodes (FNs) while meeting the quality of service (QoS) requirements of IoT tasks. We also consider the minimization of the deadline violation time in our model.

We evaluate the performance of the proposed task scheduling approaches with respect to the percentage of IoT tasks that meet their deadline requirement, total energy consumption, total deadline violation time, and the system's makespan. Compared with existing algorithms, the experiment results confirm that the proposed algorithms improve the percentage of tasks meeting their deadline requirement up to 1.35x and decrease the total deadline violation time up to 97.6% compared to the second-best results, respectively, while the energy consumption of fog resources and makespan of the system are optimized. © 2022","Cloud computing; Deadline-aware; Energy consumption; Fog computing; Internet of Things; Semi-greedy algorithm; Task scheduling","Delay-sensitive applications; Energy efficiency; Fog; Fog computing; Internet of things; Quality of service; Scheduling algorithms; Cloud-computing; Computing system; Deadline-aware; Energy efficient; Energy-consumption; Greedy algorithms; Makespan; Semi-greedy algorithm; Tasks scheduling; Total energy; Energy utilization",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123888500

We propose to detect anomalies by quantifying the dynamic variations of generalized model implied by operating data, and present a mode division as the novel detection framework. The subspace technique and a quantization method for the amplitude-frequency characteristic deviation are employed to design the detector, which can be deployed independently in the active ICPS and does not cause any loss of control performance.

Although the ripple voltage of a PFM buck converter can be reduced by increasing the output capacitance, we find that this leads to a decrease in the light-load efficiency due to increased controller loss. This problem is analyzed and verified by IC measurements in this article. The proposed PFM buck converter remarkably reduces the controller loss even at low ripple voltages by replacing the static comparator with a dynamic comparator, which provides a high voltage gain, fast evaluation speed, and low power consumption.

We then discuss the non-linear nature of the EV charging load and simulate multiple attacks that can be launched against the power grid using these EVs. EV loads have high reactive power demand which can have a larger impact on the grid compared to residential loads. We perform simulations on two power grids and demonstrate that while the grid can recover after a 48 MW attack utilizing traditional residential loads, a smaller 30 MW EV load attack can completely destabilize the system.

However, the open nature of 5G networks threatens the safe sharing of data. In particular, privacy leakage can lead to serious losses for users. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) avoids privacy leakage by allowing data models to be shared instead of raw data. Unfortunately, the traditional FL framework is strongly dependent on a centralized aggregation server, which will cause the system to crash if the server is compromised. Unauthorized participants may launch poisoning attacks, thereby reducing the usability of models. In addition, communication barriers hinder collaboration among a large number of cross-domain devices for learning. To address the abovementioned issues, a blockchain-empowered decentralized horizontal FL framework is proposed. The authentication of cross-domain UAVs is accomplished through multisignature smart contracts. Global model updates are computed by using these smart contracts instead of a centralized server. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high efficiency of cross-domain authentication and good accuracy. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); cross-domain authentication; federated learning (FL); privacy preservation; smart contract","5G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Authentication; Blockchain; Data privacy; Internet of things; Learning systems; 5g-enabled UAV; Block-chain; Centralised; Cross-domain; Cross-domain authentication; Decentralised; Federated learning; Learning frameworks; Privacy leakages; Privacy preservation; Drones",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117762753

Researchers have proposed various detection methods fostered by machine learning (ML) techniques. Federated learning (FL), as a promising distributed ML paradigm, has been employed recently to improve detection performance due to its advantages of privacy-preserving and lower latency. However, existing FL-based methods still suffer from efficiency, robustness, and security challenges. To address these problems, in this article, we initially introduce a blockchain-empowered decentralized and asynchronous FL framework for anomaly detection in IoT systems, which ensures data integrity and prevents single-point failure while improving the efficiency. Further, we design an improved differentially private FL based on generative adversarial nets, aiming to optimize data utility throughout the training process. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first system to employ a decentralized FL approach with privacy-preserving for IoT anomaly detection.

However, the latency brought by unstable wireless networks and computation failures caused by limited resources on IoT devices prevents users from experiencing high efficiency and seamless user experience. To address these shortcomings, the integrated Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) with remote clouds is a promising platform to enable delay-sensitive service provisioning for IoT applications, where edge-clouds (cloudlets) are co-located with wireless access points in the proximity of IoT devices. Thus, computation-intensive and sensing data from IoT devices can be offloaded to the MEC network immediately for processing, and the service response latency can be significantly reduced. In this paper, we first formulate two novel optimization problems for delay-sensitive IoT applications, i.e., the total utility maximization problems under both static and dynamic offloading task request settings, with the aim to maximize the accumulative user satisfaction on the use of the services provided by the MEC, and show the NP-hardness of the defined problems. We then devise efficient approximation and online algorithms with provable performance guarantees for the problems in a special case where the bandwidth capacity constraint is negligible. We also develop efficient heuristic algorithms for the problems with the bandwidth capacity constraint. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations.

Distributed ML exploits recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology advancements to allow collaborated ML, whilst safeguarding private data, minimizing both communication and computation overhead along with addressing ultra-low latency requirements. In this paper, we review a number of distributed ML architectures and designs, that focus on optimizing communication, computation and resource distribution.

To meet this challenge, various efforts have been made in today's wireless network technologies, such as LTE eMTC, 5G NB-IoT, IEEE 802.11ah, BLE, etc. Meanwhile, most of these technologies consider multi-hop wireless relaying to extend the wireless coverage and to enhance the network transmission capacity. Despite the benefits, however, the usage of multi-hop relaying has been limited in the real world, because of the performance degradation caused by the self-interference between adjacent wireless links. In this paper, we tackle the problem of alleviating the performance degradation in the multi-hop wireless network for IoT devices. In particular, we target low cost IoT devices that are equipped with inexpensive wireless links such as WiFi, IEEE 802.15.4, and Bluetooth. Our approach is to avoid self-interference by controlling the transmission timing at each hop. More specifically, our design goal is to minimize the data delivery delay for fast IoT sensing by preventing packet collisions (i.e., collision-free transmission). Since the retransmission at the IoT devices is eliminated, buffering at the intermediate nodes is not necessary so that no extra storage is consumed at the IoT devices to store the data being relayed. We present an algorithm to produce the packet transmission schedule at each hop. We prove that our algorithm is optimal in terms of data delivery delay (i.e., minimal delay is guaranteed) while collision between transmissions is completely avoided. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Collision-free scheduling; Delay minimization; Internet of Things; Multi-hop wireless networks; Time Sensitive Networks","5G mobile communication systems; Costs; Digital storage; IEEE Standards; Packet networks; Scheduling algorithms; Wireless networks; Collision-free; Collision-free scheduling; Data delivery delays; Delay minimization; Low-costs; Multi-hops; Performance degradation; Self-interferences; Time sensitive network; Wireless link; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124567081

However, such security-related assumptions can easily fall when considering the exposure of fog nodes’ location, the heterogeneity of device providers, and the ease of misuse and misconfigurations by end-users, to name a few. As a result, compromised fog nodes can stealthily steal sensitive information, such as the devices’ location, path, and private personal attributes. This paper presents PARFAIT, a privacy-preserving, secure, and low-delay framework for securely accessing services in fog-enabled IoT ecosystems. PARFAITguarantees low-delay authentication and authorization to local fog nodes, protecting the identity and the attributes possessed by the IoT devices.

As one of the representative models of microgrid, various studies on campus microgrids (CMGs) have been conducted. In operation of CMG, various energy consumption resources and renewable energy are considered to minimize overall cost or peak power in the system. However, most of conventional researches only deal with performance analysis in terms of simulation by collecting data from the different environments. In this case, there are lack of consideration in power regulation or electricity cost which make it difficult to apply the researched energy operation technology to the actual power system. To solve the problem, this paper build a test-bed in an actual CMG environment and collect dataset through the various IoT sensors. In addition, uncertainties that occur through the various power resources are analyzed and used to derive net energy consumption scenarios. In this way, we propose a new cost optimal energy management model with the detailed analysis of power generation and consumption using various auxiliary IoT devices.

To do so, eight well-known metaheuristic algorithms are employed to determine the trustworthiness of MHKC against cryptoanalysis attacks using various knapsack lengths, ranging from 8 to 32 bits. The experimental findings showed that pathfinder algorithm (PFA) and slime mold optimizer (SMA) could exploit MHKC under 8-bit ASCII code, and their performance gradually deteriorates with higher bit representations, while the performance of manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) could be superior for the knapsack lengths higher than 8-bit. Additionally, MRFO would not attack MHKC under 32-bit; thus, some genetic operators have been integrated to manipulate the binary solutions obtained by this algorithm to promote its exploration capability in a variant, namely HMRFO.

This data fusion helps us to achieve higher forecasting accuracy along with the integration of state of the art gradient boosting based categorical features supported CatBoost algorithm.

Most of the existing work focuses only on how to effectively schedule computing resources to execute computing requirements of simulation workflows in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Research on the scheduling of simulation workflows in consideration of task ordering, service selection, and resource allocation altogether has not been lacking. To fill in this void, this paper proposes a cloud-based 3-stage workflow scheduling model. Before scheduling computing resources to complete task requirements, the order of the tasks is determined and the services that can meet the task requirements are selected. In this model, the workload to satisfy task requirements is not fixed and takes on a different value depending upon the service selected with its unique complexity and accuracy. An optimization function that transforms and integrates makespan, cost, and accuracy in a unique way is proposed. For its solution, the relatively new symbiotic organisms search (SOS) algorithm is modified and two SOS-based optimization strategies are developed, i.e., joint optimization-based SOS (JOSOS) and split optimization-based SOS (SOSOS). The simulation results reveal that SOS-based algorithms, especially the SOSOS method, outperform all compared algorithms. Based on the proposed method, simulation services and computing resources can be rationally selected and scheduled to ensure the requirements of IoT applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cloud computing scheduling; Internet of Things (IoT); Service sharing and selection; Smart manufacturing process; Symbiotic organisms search","Industrial research; Internet of things; Manufacture; Systems engineering; Cloud computing scheduling; Cloud-computing; Internet of thing; Manufacturing process; Service selection; Service-sharing; Smart manufacturing; Smart manufacturing process; Symbiotic organism search; Symbiotics; Scheduling",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124295536

This angle is traditionally estimated considering the geographical position, however, this approach ignores the existence of local elements that affect the generation, such as weather conditions, topography, constructions with high reflection, among others. Therefore, this work presents the design and construction of a measurement device with nine irradiance sensors, which are located at different angles on two orthogonal axes within a semisphere. Since the angles of the sensors are known, a model to determine the direction of the maximum incidence irradiance, at each instant of time, can be calculated from the on-site measurements. In this way, it is also possible to calculate the panel inclination and orientation producing the maximum power for a particular location. The device acquires the irradiance magnitude in the nine sensors in real time, and it is transmitted using the Internet to simplify data recollection. Finally, the device uses a low-cost platform, which makes possible the adoption of this solution in a wide range of applications, e.g. design, diagnostic or reconfiguration of PV arrays. © 2022 The Author(s)","Embedded system; Internet of Things (IoT); Irradiance incident angle; Photovoltaic systems","Costs; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Real time systems; Solar power generation; Topography; Embedded-system; Incidence angles; Incident angles; Internet of thing; Irradiance incident angle; Low-cost systems; Photovoltaic systems; Power production; Real- time; Solar irradiances; Solar cells",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124234365

However, smart satellite networks attract the attention of hackers, resulting in them being targeted by severe cyber-attacks that can compromise their integrity, affect their availability, or breach the confidentiality of the data they generate, collect or rout. Lately, several prominent cyber-attacking scenarios have been observed to target IoT-enabled systems, resulting in loss, alteration, or exfiltration of data, disabling of devices, (distributed) denial of services, the formation of botnets, and lateral movement into otherwise secured networks.

This paper presents the design, implementation and integration of the Architecture for Orchestration and Management of Cloud-Network Slices (CNS-AOM), a modular architecture to orchestrate and manage slice resources and services in CNSs. The CNS-AOM is designed and implemented considering three important characteristics: (i) the business model called Slice-as-a-Service (SlaaS); (ii) the multiple administrative and technological domains; and (iii) the slice elasticity, which means the capacity of dynamically growing and shrinking the slice resources to improve service performance. To prove the feasibility of our proposal, two Proofs of Concept (PoC) are implemented in real environments to validate the CNS-AOM. First, an end-to-end content distribution service (CDN) is deployed across three different cities in Brazil to emphasize the multiple domains. Second, we present an IoT service using a fully-featured commercial service platform called dojot, which is instantiated and orchestrated by the proposed architecture. The dojot slice is instantiated overseas in four cities across two countries. The evaluation for the CDN slice considers the appropriate metrics that should be monitored and the actual services that should be instantiated to meet the end-user’s requirements depending on its location. Moreover, in the dojot slice, elasticity operations (vertical and horizontal) are tested and evaluated along with the time taken to deploy the slice infrastructure and the service.

Moreover, worker's privacy has been a public concern throughout recent years. Therefore, there must be a trade-off between developing accurate thermal comfort prediction models and worker's privacy-preserving.

Our architecture provides a cross-layer graph-based view of the end-to-end path between devices and the cloud. IoTManA has been implemented in a set of software components named IoT management system (IoTManS) and tested in two scenarios—Smart Agriculture and Smart Cities—showing that it can significantly contribute to harnessing the complexity of managing IoT solutions. The cross-layer graph-based modeling of IoTManA facilitates the implemented management system (IoTManS) to detect and identify root causes of typically distributed failures occurring in IoT solutions. We conducted a performance analysis of IoTManS focusing on two aspects—failure detection time and scalability—to demonstrate application scenarios and capabilities. The results show that IoTManS can detect and identify the root cause of failures in 806ms to 90,036ms depending on its operation mode, adapting to different IoT needs.

Some sensors deployed for these purposes such as temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and carbon dioxide sensors require protection from climate factors to avoid bias. Radiation shields hold and protect sensors to avoid this bias, but commercial systems are limited, often expensive, and difficult to implement in low-cost contexts or large deployments for collaborative sensing. To overcome these challenges, this work presents an open source, easily adapted and customized design of a radiation shield. The device can be fabricated with inexpensive off-the-shelf parts and 3-D printed components and can be adapted to protect and isolate different types of sensors. Two material approaches are tested here: polylactic acid (PLA), the most common 3-D printing filament, and acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA), which is known to offer better resistance against UV radiation, greater hardness, and generally higher resistance to degradation. To validate the designs, the two prototypes were installed on a custom outdoor meteorological system and temperature and humidity measurements were made in several locations for one month and compared against a proprietary system and a system with no shield. The 3-D printed materials were also both tested multiple times for one month for UV stability of their mechanical properties, their optical transmission and deformation under outdoor high-heat conditions. The results showed that ASA is the preferred material for this design and that the open source radiation shield could match the performance of proprietary systems. The open source system can be constructed for about nine US dollars, which enables mass development of flexible weather stations for monitoring needed in smart agriculture. © 2022 The Author(s)","3-D printing; Additive manufacturing; Climatic variables; Environmental monitoring; Environmental sensing; Environmental variables; Internet of Things (IoT); low cost; Open hardware; Radiation shield; Sensing; Smart agriculture","3D printers; Agriculture; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Internet of things; Light transmission; Radiation shielding; Styrene; 3-D printing; Climatic variables; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental sensing; Environmental variables; Internet of thing; Low-costs; Open hardware; Open-source; Smart agricultures; Costs",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123942862

Transmitting ECG data to a cardiologist without security may incline to misdiagnosis. In this paper, a novel method for secured ECG transmission to cardiologist for clinical healthcare has been proposed. Firstly, ECG datasets are taken from the MIT-BIH database and pre-processed. Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter has been used for the removal of low-frequency noise, while high frequency noise is eliminated using maximal overlap wavelet packet transform (MOWPT) followed by features extraction. For security, triple data encryption standard (3-DES) has been implemented for encryption and water cycle optimization (WCO) algorithm is employed for authentication. Then encrypted and authenticated ECG features are transmitted to cardiologist for analysis via ThingSpeak, an internet of things (IoT) platform. The performance of the proposed method is calculated viz. avalanche effect is 50.12% and mean square error is 0.463, number of pixels change rate (NPCR) is 100, unified averaged changed intensity (UACI) is 39.698 and execution time is 0.003 msec.

The security of IoV can protect the peer-to-peer (P2P) data transmitted over Internet. Since most Internet devices are components with low battery power, low communication and computational power, the key distribution scheme for IoV needs to be lightweight. Most conventional communications in Internet of Vehicles are one-to-one types of communications which involve only two communication entities. Proposals for key distribution schemes are mostly developed to establish a pairwise key for a pair of users. For example, Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution scheme proposed in 1976 and the quantum key distribution scheme (QKD) invented in 1984 (also called the BB84 scheme), can only enable two users to share a secret key used in conventional one-to-one communications. Modern communications have been evolved into many-to-many types of communications which involve more than two users. Group-key distributions enable multiple users to share a group key. Recently, a lightweight group-key distribution scheme has been proposed which needs only logic operations. But this scheme can only provide confidentiality of the group key. In this paper, we extend that scheme to propose the first lightweight authenticated group-key distribution scheme which needs only logic operations. Our proposed schemes can be built on top of any type of authenticated pairwise-key distribution schemes. We first propose a basic three-party authenticated group-key distribution scheme. Then, general three multiple-party authenticated group-key distribution schemes based on the basic scheme are proposed. Since our proposed schemes need only logic operations, they are all lightweight and are suitable for P2P IoV communication applications. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Group key distribution; Internet of things; IoV; Lightweight; Pairwise keys; Secure communications",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123627159

The IoT-enabled edge-computing paradigm provides ubiquitous computing and resource access for the robots for robust services. The interactive sessions and partial computations of the robots result in unnecessary exploitation of real-time resources. This paper introduces a swarm intelligence-based modular interactive computation scheme (MICS) for IoT-assisted robots to address the incompleteness in resource utilization and reduce computational complexity. In this scheme, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is incorporated with intelligent decision-making. The role of swarm intelligence is to improve interactive computations using different agents that provide offloading support. The flexible sharing of swarm agents provides shared resource utilization and comprehensive calculations for robot-based assistance. The proposed scheme performs computing and interaction decisions based on the robot inputs and its parallel processing feature. The proposed scheme's performance is verified using the metrics interaction span, decision complexity, offloading ratio, computing time, and outages.

This is often achieved through integration: IoT is being integrated into billions of intelligent objects, commonly labeled “things,” from which the service collects various forms of data regarding both these “things” themselves as well as their environment. While IoT and IoT-powered devices can provide invaluable services in various fields, unauthorized access and inadvertent modification are potential issues of tremendous concern. In this paper, we present a process for resolving such IoT issues using adapted long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN). With this method, we utilize specialized deep learning (DL) methods to detect abnormal and/or suspect behavior in IoT systems. LSTM RNNs are adopted in order to construct a high-accuracy model capable of detecting suspicious behavior based on a dataset of IoT sensors readings. The model is evaluated using the Intel Labs dataset as a test domain, performing four different tests, and using three criteria: F1, Accuracy, and time.

In particular dense WSNs are emerging as an important sensing platforms for the Internet of Things (IoT). WSNs are able to generate huge volumes of raw data, which require network structuring and efficient collaboration between nodes to ensure efficient transmission. In order to reduce the amount of data carried in the network, data aggregation is used in WSNs to define a policy of data fusion and compression. In this paper, we investigate a model for data aggregation in a dense WSN with a single sink. The model divides a circular coverage region centered at the sink into patches which are intersections of sectors of concentric rings, and data in each patch is aggregated at a single node before transmission. Nodes only communicate with other nodes in the same sector. Based on these assumptions, we formulate a linear programming problem to maximize system lifetime by minimizing the maximum proportionate energy consumption over all nodes. Under a wide variety of conditions, the optimal solution employs two transmissions mechanisms: direct transmission, in which nodes send information directly to the sink; and stepwise transmission, in which nodes transmit information to adjacent nodes. An exact formula is given for the proportionate energy consumption rate of the network. Asymptotic forms of this exact solution are also derived, and are verified to agree with the linear programming solution. We investigate three strategies for improving system lifetime: nonuniform energy and information density; iterated compression; and modifications of rings. We conclude that iterated compression brings the greatest increase in system lifetime, but at the cost of possible information loss. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Data aggregation; Data compression; Dense wireless sensor network; Lifetime extension; Linear programming","Data fusion; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Linear programming; Sensor nodes; Data aggregation; Dense wireless sensor network; Environmental conditions; Lifetime extension; Linear-programming; Network efficient; Network structuring; Optimisations; Sensing platforms; System lifetimes; Data compression",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122507464

In this work, we present an efficient and robust framework to recognize anomalies from surveillance Big Video Data (BVD) using Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Smart surveillance is an important application of AIoT and we propose a two-stream neural network in this direction. The first stream comprises instant anomaly detection that is functional over resource-constrained IoT devices, whereas second phase is a two-stream deep neural network allowing for detailed anomaly analysis, suited to be deployed as a cloud computing service. Firstly, a self-pruned fine-tuned lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) classifies the ongoing events as normal or anomalous in an AIoT environment. Upon anomaly detection, the edge device alerts the concerned departments and transmits the anomalous frames to cloud analysis center for their detailed evaluation in the second phase. The cloud analysis center resorts to the proposed two-stream network, modeled from the integration of spatiotemporal and optical flow features through the sequential frames. Fused features flow through a bi-directional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) layer, which classifies them into their respective anomaly classes, e.g., assault and abuse. We perform extensive experiments over benchmarks built on top of the UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 datasets to test the effectiveness of our framework. We report a 9.88% and 4.01% increase in accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art methods evaluated over the aforementioned datasets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Anomaly detection; Anomaly recognition; Surveillance videos; Two-stream network","Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Internet of things; Long short-term memory; Monitoring; Security systems; Video recording; Anomaly detection; Anomaly recognition; Cloud analysis; Neural-networks; Second phase; Stream networks; Surveillance video; Two-stream; Two-stream network; Visual sensor; Anomaly detection",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121546312

At the same time, the environmental branch of toxicology has gained significant attention in understanding the effect of toxic chemicals on human health. Environmental toxic agents cause several diseases, particularly high risk among children, pregnant women, geriatrics and clinical patients. Since air pollution affects human health and results in increased morbidity and mortality increased the toxicological studies focusing on industrial air pollution absorbed by the common people. Therefore, it is needed to design an automated Environmental Toxicology based Air Pollution Monitoring System. To resolve the limitations of traditional monitoring system and to reduce the overall cost, this paper designs an IoT enabled Environmental Toxicology for Air Pollution Monitoring using Artificial Intelligence technique (ETAPM-AIT) to improve human health. The proposed ETAPM-AIT model includes a set of IoT based sensor array to sense eight pollutants namely NH3, CO, NO2, CH4, CO2, PM2.5, temperature and humidity. The sensor array measures the pollutant level and transmits it to the cloud server via gateways for analytic process. The proposed model aims to report the status of air quality in real time by using cloud server and sends an alarm in the presence of hazardous pollutants level in the air. For the classification of air pollutants and determining air quality, Artificial Algae Algorithm (AAA) based Elman Neural Network (ENN) model is used as a classifier, which predicts the air quality in the forthcoming time stamps. The AAA is applied as a parameter tuning technique to optimally determine the parameter values of the ENN model. In-order to examine the air quality monitoring performance of the proposed ETAPM-AIT model, an extensive set of simulation analysis is performed and the results are inspected in 5, 15, 30 and 60 min of duration respectively. The experimental outcome highlights the optimal performance of the proposed ETAPM-AIT model over the recent techniques. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Air quality; Artificial intelligence; Environmental toxicology; Human health; Internet of things; Pollution monitoring","carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; ecotoxicology; health risk; mass mortality; morbidity; mortality; pollution monitoring; risk factor; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; artificial intelligence; back propagation neural network; cloud computing; controlled study; human; humidity; particulate matter 2.5; pollution monitoring; simulation; temperature",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121255385

What was once a dream for the future has now become reality. However, the need to provide these smart services quickly, efficiently, in an interoperable manner and in real time is a cutting-edge technological challenge. Although some software architectures offer solutions in this area, these are often limited in terms of reusability and maintenance by independent modules —involving the need for system downtime when maintaining or evolving, as well as by a lack of standards in terms of the interoperability of their interface. In this paper, we propose a fully reusable microservice architecture, standardized through the use of the Web of things paradigm, and with high efficiency in real-time data processing, supported by complex event processing techniques. To illustrate the proposal, we present a fully reusable implementation of the microservices necessary for the deployment of the architecture in the field of air quality monitoring and alerting in smart ports.

However, it causes privacy risk due to the data exchanges between local devices and untrusted edge servers.

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving IoT streaming data analytical framework based on edge computing, called PrivStream, to prevent the untrusted edge server from making sensitive inferences from the IoT streaming data. It utilizes a well-designed deep learning model to filter the sensitive information and combines with differential privacy to protect against the untrusted edge server. The noise is also injected into the framework in the training phase to increase the robustness of PrivStream to differential privacy noise. Taking into account the dynamic and real-time characteristics of streaming data, we realize PrivStream with two types of models to process data segment with fixed length and variable length, respectively, and implement it on a distributed streaming platform to achieve real-time streaming data transmission.

Interesting solutions have been proposed in the past, which own the necessary mechanisms to allow users keeping control over their personal information and setting the rules to regulate the access of other users. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of this type of solutions is severely reduced by the fact that different user communities with a shared interest could be disconnected/separated from each other. This translates into a reduced ability in effectively spreading data of common interest towards all interested users, as it currently happens in centralized social networks. In order to overcome the cited limitation, this paper proposes a disruptive approach, which exploits the availability of a new class of Internet of Things (IoT) devices with autonomous social behaviors and cognitive abilities. Such devices can be leveraged as friendship intermediaries between devices’ owners who are connected to a DOSN platform and share the same interest.

These sensors are used not only to collect data but, more importantly, to assist in tracking and analyzing the daily human activities. Sensor-based human activity recognition is a hotspot and starts to employ deep learning approaches to supersede traditional shallow learning that rely on hand-crafted features. Although many successful methods have been proposed, there are three challenges to overcome: (1) deep model's performance overly depends on the data size; (2) deep model cannot explicitly capture abundant sample distribution characteristics; (3) deep model cannot jointly consider sample features, sample distribution characteristics, and the relationship between the two. To address these issues, we propose a meta-learning-based graph prototypical model with priority attention mechanism for sensor-based human activity recognition. This approach learns not only sample features and sample distribution characteristics via meta-learning-based graph prototypical model, but also the embeddings derived from priority attention mechanism that mines and utilizes relations between sample features and sample distribution characteristics. What is more, the knowledge learned through our approach can be seen as a priori applicable to improve the performance for other general reasoning tasks. Experimental results on fourteen datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. On the other hand, experiments of applying our model to two other tasks show that our model effectively supports other recognition tasks related to human activity and improves performance on the datasets of these tasks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Attention mechanisms; Graph model; Internet of Things; Meta-learning","Deep learning; Palmprint recognition; Wearable sensors; Attention mechanisms; Distribution characteristics; Feature distribution; Graph model; Human activities; Human activity recognition; Metalearning; Rapid growth; Sample distributions; Sample features; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119181735

Although multisensor information fusion can be addressed by multiview learning, its performance tends to degrade if any one sensor is disturbed with annoying noises by the environment or other factors. Therefore, fusing these cross-sensor data in a reliable and secure manner while removing those noises is crucial. Although there have been outlier-against multiview works proposed, most of them suffer from redundant parameters or performance degradation. Even worse, few of them have considered the complementary information across the sensors. In this article, we argue that in multiview information fusion, not only the clean data, but also those outliers share the same prototypes in a common space, except that the outliers are disturbed with noises. To this end, we propose a type of robust multiview prototype (RMVP) learning to fuse the sensing data while removing the noises automatically in the learning process. Specifically, in RMVP, projection matrices are designed for each sensing view to sketch the data prototypes. In addition, one auxiliary margin matrix is modeled for each sensing view to capture its data noises through penalizing a sparsity regularization on it. Afterwards, an alternating algorithm is presented to solve the proposed model. Finally, extensive experiments on intelligent sensing data sets are conducted to testify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Internet of Things; multiview learning; outlier detection; prototype learning; reliable sensing data fusion","Data fusion; Information fusion; Common spaces; Learning process; Multi-sensor information fusion; Multi-view learning; Performance degradation; Prototype learning; Redundant parameters; Sensing data; Statistics",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102616813

Mainly because manufacturers overlook the security considerations and produce devices that could be exploited easily. Security systems used for the protection of IoT environment usually deploy traditional rulesets which lack distinct IoT vulnerability assessment elements and therefore are inadequate for providing security to IoT eco-system. Hence, due to the variety and volume of such devices, traditional security solutions need to be more robust for IoT settings. Contrary to the traditional rule-set, IoT device vulnerability identification requires distinct understanding of IoT-specific vulnerability vectors, based on their architecture, resource constrained nature, communication primitives and context awareness. This research work has proposed an automated context-aware IoT vulnerability assessment rule-set framework. Proposed system dynamically identifies IoT devices along with the services running on them, gathers their respective vulnerabilities, transform them into rules and enforce them into the security solutions. The proposed framework has been evaluated on a dataset of 49 IoT devices. According to the results, proposed framework automatically generated rules against all the vulnerabilities present in the network under consideration. Additionally, this research has proposed IoT vulnerability assessment rule-set elements which are necessary to be considered while designing any IoT vulnerability assessment rule-set. With the proposed mechanism, this research work intends to fill the missing lines of defense against rising IoT vulnerabilities.

However, improper use of RFID tags is highly likely to threaten the safety and privacy of hospitals and even patients, which may not only cause physical and mental harm to patients but also damage the reputation of hospitals. Medical monitoring system based on RFID technology plays a significant role in guaranteeing the security of medical records as well as the privacy of patients. Nevertheless, due to the resource constraint of RFID tags/readers, it is also challenging to design an efficient and effective authentication protocol for RFID medical monitoring system. Aiming to reduce the resource overhead and meet security requirements of the RFID system, in this paper, we propose an ultra-lightweight RFID security authentication protocol utilizing a cloud server named CRUSAP, which is based on Bit-Crossing XOR rearrangement operations that can effectively resist forgery attacks, replay attacks, desynchronization attacks, and denial of service attacks while certifying the cloud server. The formal logic of BAN proves the safety and feasibility of the protocol.

Prevailing approaches mainly adopt ambient sensors, wearables or vision cameras, which suffer from insensitive perception, arduous deployment or privacy-leakage risks. Recently developed WiFi-based methods circumvent the above limitations, however, most of them require sufficient training samples and computational resources for a comprehensive understanding of behavior patterns. This scenario requires occupant cooperation and considerable energy consumption. In this paper, we propose the use of LT-WiOB, which is a lightweight triplet framework for WiFi-based occupant behavior recognition, that provides a cost-efficient and user-friendly solution. Technically, the novelties of LT-WiOB are threefold. For the insufficient data problem, an efficient triplet framework is presented to measure the embedding dependencies; it attempts to avoid the ambiguity of new samples from each class and allows only a few samples to be entered. Regarding inefficient computation, a lightweight convolutional module is specifically designed and implemented to reduce the model complexity. For unstable training, the triplet architecture is further enhanced by employing a novel triplet sampling strategy that creates useful triplet candidates. Extensive experiments were conducted for performance comparison under diverse environmental settings. The results showed that LT-WiOB realizes the best overall accuracy of 96.1% and achieves over 90% and 85% accuracy in the five-shot and one-shot conditions, respectively, with almost half of the computation cost being saved.

Special correlation functions called Product Densities are used to (a) evaluate time-dependent offered traffic, and (b) analyze delay performance. These performance measures are evaluated at IoT base station for Poisson as well as non-Homogeneous Poisson (Beta distributed) traffic arrival processes suggested by 3rd Generation Partnership Project(3GPP).

Consequently, nodes providing the best routes are potentially the first ones to deplete their batteries and stop working. In this paper, we introduce a novel routing strategy for energy efficient and balanced data collection in WSNs/IoT, which can be applied to any cost-based routing solution to exploit suboptimal network routing alternatives based on the parent set concept.

A huge number of techniques have been proposed and implemented to improve the performance and accuracy of intrusion detection models. In recent years, efforts have been made to keep the attack surface as small as possible. However, the attack vectors have evolved in terms of complexity and diversity, and various intelligent techniques have been employed by the adversaries to exploit the ecosystems. This exploitation can either make the whole system dysfunctional or may lead to important information leakage. More specifically, with the evolution of Internet of Things (IoT), more heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices are interconnecting with each other. These devices have limited processing power and resources, particularly for detecting intrusions. Consequently, Swarm Intelligence (SI) based techniques have received considerable attention, especially in the past decade, as the SI approaches have achieved a decent success rate by optimizing various aspects of an IDS. This paper presents a systematic review with a thorough coverage of articles published between 2010 and 2020 of the state-of-the-art swarm intelligence approaches deployed in various attack surfaces for intrusion detection in various domains. The paper also presents a categorization in accordance with applicability of these SI approaches in improving various aspects of an intrusion detection process. Moreover, the paper also discusses the capabilities and features of various datasets used in experimentation. This aims to help researchers in assessing the capabilities and limitations of SI algorithms to identify security threats and challenges to design and implement an IDS for the detection of cyber attacks in various domains. Moreover, this will also help security individuals in differentiating SI based IDS with traditional ones.

Indeed, exploitation of such devices can directly lead to physical consequences in the real world. Previous work has shown that IoT devices can be compromised by exploits in lower software layers such as the Operating System (OS). Embedded Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provide a small Trusted Computing Base (TCB) to protect sensitive codes and data in such devices. TEEs assume a strong threat model where even a privileged attacker (e.g. OS) cannot compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the execution. Nevertheless, it has been shown that side channel attacks make it challenging to keep secrets during application execution. Interrupt latency side channel attacks (a.k.a. Nemesis) are a novel type of timing attacks that target embedded TEEs and extract application secrets from them. Nemesis attacks exploit the CPU's interrupt mechanism to reveal microarchitectural instruction timings from embedded TEEs. Specifically, the attacker measures the latency of a precisely timed interrupt to differentiate between secret-dependent branches. In this paper, we present NemesisGuard, the first mitigation mechanism against such side channel attacks that does not require a modified compiler or hardware and can protect COTS binaries without access to source code. NemesisGuard applies a novel static binary instrumentation technique to balance secret-dependent branches in IoT application binaries. Evaluation of NemesisGuard shows that it mitigates Nemesis side channel attacks effectively and efficiently. © 2021","IoT security; Side channel attacks; Static binary instrumentation","Codes (symbols); Side channel attack; Trusted computing; Application execution; Binary instrumentations; Internet of thing security; Interrupt latency; Real-world; Side-channel attacks; Static binary instrumentation; Threat modeling; Trusted computing base; Trusted execution environments; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122818867

Protocols that allow these deceives to interconnect peer-to-peer through wireless links are becoming of interest. The major challenge is the inevitable interference among the simultaneously activated wireless links. Given a set of wireless links, this article addresses the non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard problem of selecting the maximum subset of links that can be simultaneously activated at their respective signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) targets. The contribution of this article is two-fold. First, we introduce a new genetic algorithm (GA) constraint-handling mechanism, and prove analytically that finding optimal link schedules is guaranteed. Second, we develop a novel parallelized GA to solve the problem. Through serial algorithm analysis, we utilize data decomposition as well as exploratory decomposition in order to achieve significant running time speedup, which scales well with problem size. Our numerical results for openMP parallelization illustrate 6.5 (Formula presented.) and 5.4 (Formula presented.) reduction in computation time as compared to the serial versions of the GA and hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), respectively.

While current research on the opportunistic social network does not take the redundant influence of high-speed data transmission into account, which leads to problems such as lower delivery ratio, we present an effective data transmission scheme based on IoT system (EDTS). To divide the community, which consists of devices with relatively close connections, we measure the social relationship of nodes by quantifying the remaining cache, social relation, and interest similarity in opportunistic social networks. An efficient strategy is designed in this paper to update the community by analyzing the change of edge weights between two nodes in the community, deciding whether the community should be further divided, and whether the nodes should join the larger community. The proposed scheme also involves data transmission methods based on community, which involve inter-community forwarding and intra-community forwarding.

Fog computing (FC) takes the cloud closer to IoT computers to overcome these problems. Rather than moving them to the cloud, the FC provides local IoT data processing and storage on IoT computers. This paper focuses on the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Network (RPL), a universally routing protocol for a static environment that is used for reducing energy consumption, delay, and packet loss with data aggregation at the border router using a fog simulation model in Contiki Cooja. The objective function (OF) choice has an impact on network topology, as each node selects a set of potential parents to send to the destination. However, no systematic analysis of the effects of OF behavior in the RPL environment has been undertaken. Here, three different OFs, Objective Function Zero (OF0), Advanced Objective Function Zero (AOF0), and Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective Function (MRHOF) for RPL in the static environment for different node numbers, have been compared. The findings demonstrate that altering all three OFs has a significant impact on RPL. The energy consumption is reduced in the case of the AOF0 in the fog node by 50.86%, which is less than the case of the OF0 and MRHOF function. Extensive simulations show that AOF0 outperforms the existing OFs. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"Data handling; Digital storage; Directed graphs; Edge computing; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fog; Fog computing; Green computing; Internet protocols; Low power electronics; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; AOF0; Cloud-computing; Contiki; Destination-oriented directed acyclic graph; Edge computing; Lossy networks; Low Power Networks; Objective functions; Routing-protocol; RPL; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120371398

This study was intended to explore the acceptance of the proposed technology by the specific set of users that could potentially lead to its adoption by rescue agencies for carrying out indoor rescue and evacuation operations. The novelty of this study lies in the concept that the acceptability of the proposed system was ascertained before the complete implementation of the system, which prevented potential losses of time and other resources.

Other factors include trust in the proposed system, job relevance, and information requirement characteristics. Online survey data collected from the respondents were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM) revealed that although perceived ease of use and job relevance had significant impacts on perceived usefulness, trust had a somewhat milder impact on the same. The model also demonstrated a statistically moderate impact of trust and perceived ease of use on behavioural intention. All other relationships were statistically strong. Overall, all proposed relationships were supported, with the research model providing a better understanding of the perceptions of users towards the adoption of the proposed technology.

One of the main challenges we are actually facing is constituted by the constrained sizes of such objects: reduced memory, reduced computational capacity, and reduced battery sizes. Particular attention should be devoted to energy efficiency, since a potential energy shortage would negatively impact not only its operation but also network-wide operation, considering the tight connections among any object. According to the 6G system’s use-case related to self-sustainability and zero-energy networks, this paper focuses on an energy-efficient fog network architecture for IoT scenarios, jointly implementing computation offloading operations and simultaneous wireless information and power Transfer (SWIPT), hence, enabling the possibility of jointly transferring energy and computational tasks among the nodes. The system under consideration is composed of three nodes, where an access point (AP) is considered to be always connected to the power network, while a relay node and an end node can harvest energy from the AP. The proposed solution allows to jointly optimize the computation offloading and the energy harvesting phases while maximizing the network lifetime, so as to maximize the operational time of the network.

Many studies of this type focus on generating the desired future, taking into account the fact that it is accompanied by uncertainty. The author of this publication postulates treating uncertainty as an equivalent—in relation to the future—research object. This approach allows us to formulate general assumptions for a model of the anticipatory management of systemic uncertainty in IoT networks. The goal of such a model will not be to eliminate or even minimize uncertainty, but to regulate it to a desired level. Such an action can bring many more benefits than trying to zero out uncertainty. On the general side, uncertainty can be studied in two ways: (1) as an abstract idea, or (2) as a feature of a particular structure, also with elements of research on its abstract component. In this paper the attention is focused on the second approach. The main research area is the IoT network in its broadest sense, with a particular role of the social construct, in the context of the study of systemic uncertainty in relation to selected anticipatory actions. The overarching goal is to define a desired state, or to determine what such a desired state is, of anticipatory IoT uncertainty. © 2022 by the author.

Based on this modification, we are able to demodulate the received signals without performing a complete frequency synchronization and by tolerating some timing synchronization errors. Hence, our receiver can handle ultra narrow band LoRa-like signals since it has no limitation on the maximum carrier frequency offset, as is actually the case in the deployed LoRa receivers. In addition, in the presence of the Doppler shift varying along the packet duration, DCSS shows better performance than CSS, which makes our proposed receiver a good candidate for communication with a low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite. © 2022 by the authors.

Timely and efficient spatio-temporal querying significantly improves the accuracy and intelligence of processing sensing data. Most existing query algorithms show their lack of supporting spatio-temporal queries and irregular spatial areas. In this paper, we propose two spatio-temporal query optimization algorithms based on SpatialHadoop to improve the efficiency of query spatio-temporal sensing data: (1) spatio-temporal polygon range query (STPRQ), which aims to find all records from a polygonal location in a time interval; (2) spatio-temporal k nearest neighbors query (STkNNQ), which directly searches the query point’s k closest neighbors.

Personal data are any data that identifiably describe a person. Legislative and regulatory documents adopted in recent years define the key requirements for the processing of personal data. They are based on the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency of personal data processing. Privacy policies are the only legitimate way to provide information on how the personal data of service and device users is collected, processed, and stored. Therefore, the problem of making privacy policies clear and transparent is extremely important as its solution would allow end users to comprehend the risks associated with personal data processing. Currently, a number of approaches for analyzing privacy policies written in natural language have been proposed. Most of them require a large training dataset of privacy policies. In the paper, we examine the existing corpora of privacy policies available for training, discuss their features and conclude on the need for a new dataset of privacy policies for devices and services of the Internet of Things as a part of mobile sensing networks. The authors develop a new technique for collecting and cleaning such privacy policies. The proposed technique differs from existing ones by the usage of e-commerce platforms as a starting point for document search and enables more targeted collection of the URLs to the IoT device manufacturers’ privacy policies. The software tool implementing this technique was used to collect a new corpus of documents in English containing 592 unique privacy policies. The collected corpus contains mainly privacy policies that are developed for the Internet of Things and reflect the latest legislative requirements. The paper also presents the results of the statistical and semantic analysis of the collected privacy policies.

Using drones is seen as a robust approach for mobile remote sensing operations, such as search‐and‐rescue missions, due to their speed and efficiency, which could seriously affect victims’ chances of survival. This paper aims to modify the Hata‐Davidson empirical propagation model based on RF drone measurement to con-duct searches for missing persons in complex environments with rugged areas after manmade or natural disasters. A drone was coupled with a thermal FLIR lepton camera, a microcontroller, GPS, and weather station sensors. The proposed modified model utilized the least squares tuning algorithm to fit the data measured from the drone communication system. This enhanced the RF connectivity between the drone and the local authority, as well as leading to increased coverage foot-print and, thus, the performance of wider search‐and‐rescue operations in a timely fashion using strip search patterns. The development of the proposed model considered both software simulation and hardware implementations. Since empirical propagation models are the most adjustable mod-els, this study concludes with a comparison between the modified Hata‐Davidson algorithm against other well‐known modified empirical models for validation using root mean square error (RMSE). The experimental results show that the modified Hata‐Davidson model outperforms the other empirical models, which in turn helps to identify missing persons and their locations using thermal imaging and a GPS sensor. © 2022 by the authors.

We introduce Aurora-Trinity, a novel version of light clients that addresses the above-mentioned vulnerability by relying on our original Aurora module, which extends the Ethereum Trinity client. The Aurora module efficiently discovers the presence of malicious or Byzantine nodes in distributed ledger networks with a predefined and acceptable error rate and identifies at least one honest node for persistent or ephemeral communication. The identified honest node is used to detect the latest canonical chain head or to infer the state of an entry in the ledger without downloading the header chain, making the Aurora-Trinity client extremely efficient.

As a result, visual-IoT research is gathering momentum. In visual-IoT, visual sensors, such as cameras, collect critical multimedia information about industries, healthcare, shopping, autonomous vehicles, crowd management, etc. In healthcare, patient-related data are cap-tured and then transmitted via insecure transmission lines. The security of this data are of paramount importance. Besides the fact that visual data requires a large bandwidth, the gap between communication and computation is an additional challenge for visual IoT system development. In this paper, we present SVIoT, a Secure Visual-IoT framework, which addresses the issues of both data security and resource constraints in IoT-based healthcare. This was achieved by proposing a novel reversible data hiding (RDH) scheme based on One Dimensional Neighborhood Mean Interpolation (ODNMI). The use of ODNMI reduces the computational complexity and storage/bandwidth requirements by 50 percent. We upscaled the original image from M × N to M ± 2N, dissimilar to conventional interpolation methods, wherein images are upscaled to 2M × 2N. We made use of an innovative mechanism, Left Data Shifting (LDS), before embedding data in the cover image. Before embedding the data, we encrypted it using an AES-128 encryption algorithm to offer additional security. The use of LDS ensures better perceptual quality at a relatively high payload. We achieved an average PSNR of 43 dB for a payload of 1.5 bpp (bits per pixel).

The increase in existing WSNs has resulted in the incompatibility of wireless network protocols and poses a problem that results in high acquisition or maintenance costs, increased complexity, reliability inadequacies in some instances, lack of uniformity within similar standards, and high energy consumption. To address this problem, we develop a novel machine-to-machine software-based brokerage application (known as JosNet) for interoperability and integration between Bluetooth LE, Zigbee, and Thread wireless network technologies. JosNet allows one network protocol to exchange data packets or commands with each other.

On the other hand, time/delay-sensitive and real-time applications cannot be processed in the cloud due to high latency and energy consumption. Hence, a new emerging computing model named fog has emerged to address the mentioned issues and provide a complementary solution. However, Fog nodes provide limited cloud services in minimum delay and energy at the local node, but they cannot process the highly computation-oriented IoT applications. Furthermore, an adaptive cloud-fog integrated framework is proposed to process entire IoT applications and significantly improve the latency, computation cost, load balancing, and energy consumption by accommodating the resources in the form of virtual machine instances. This article exploited the features of two metaheuristic-based techniques Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO) and Partial Swarm Optimization (PSO).

Malicious agents threaten patients’ health and life by stealing or altering data as it flows among the multiple domains of healthcare networks. The problem is likely to exacerbate with the increasing use of IoT devices, edge, and core clouds in the next generation healthcare networks. Presented in this paper is MUSE, a system of deep hierarchical stacked neural networks for timely and accurate detection of malicious activity that leads to alteration of meta-information or payload of the dataflow between the IoT gateway, edge and core clouds. Smaller models at the edge clouds take substantially less time to train as compared to the large models in the core cloud. To improve the speed of training and accuracy of detection of large core cloud models, the MUSE system uses a novel method of merging and aggregating layers of trained edge cloud models to construct a partly pre-trained core cloud model. As a result, the model in the core cloud takes substantially smaller number of epochs (6 to 8) and, consequently, less time, compared to those in the edge clouds, training of which take 35 to 40 epochs to converge. With the help of extensive evaluations, it is shown that with the MUSE system, large, merged models can be trained in significantly less time than the unmerged models that are created independently in the core cloud. Through several runs it is seen that the merged models give on an average 26.2% reduction in training times. From the experimental evaluation we demonstrate that along with fast training speeds the merged MUSE model gives high training and test accuracies, ranging from 95% to 100%, in detection of unknown attacks on dataflows. The merged model thus generalizes very well on the test data. This is a marked improvement when compared with the accuracy given by un-merged model as well as accuracy reported by other researchers with newer datasets. © 2022","Cloud networks; Critical healthcare; Deep neural networks; Edge clouds; Hierarchical neural networks; Multi-cloud systems; Network function virtualization; Stacked autoencoders","Cloud computing; Deep neural networks; Gateways (computer networks); Hierarchical systems; Internet of things; Network function virtualization; Auto encoders; Cloud modeling; Cloud networks; Cloud systems; Critical healthcare; Edge clouds; Hierarchical neural networks; Multi-cloud system; Multi-clouds; Stacked autoencoder; Health care",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124877724

Machine learning algorithms are used in a smart grid for power requirement prediction, power distribution, failure identification etc. The proposed Random Forest-based smart grid system classifies the power grid into different zones like high and low power utilization. The power zones are divided into number of sub-zones and map to random forest branches.

Efficient scheduling of application tasks in such environments is challenging due to constrained resource capabilities, mobility factors in IoT, resource heterogeneity, network hierarchy, and stochastic behaviors. Existing heuristics and Reinforcement Learning based approaches lack generalizability and quick adaptability, thus failing to tackle this problem optimally. They are also unable to utilize the temporal workload patterns and are suitable only for centralized setups. However, asynchronous-advantage-actor-critic (A3C) learning is known to quickly adapt to dynamic scenarios with less data and residual recurrent neural network (R2N2) to quickly update model parameters. Thus, we propose an A3C based real-time scheduler for stochastic Edge-Cloud environments allowing decentralized learning, concurrently across multiple agents. We use the R2N2 architecture to capture a large number of host and task parameters together with temporal patterns to provide efficient scheduling decisions. The proposed model is adaptive and able to tune different hyper-parameters based on the application requirements. We explicate our choice of hyper-parameters through sensitivity analysis.

However, collisions in the random access (RA) channel of NB-IoT can be severe due to the mismatch between frequent random access attempts by a huge number of devices and the limited radio resources. In this paper, a new random access mechanism called time-alignment-value based random access (TARA) is designed to improve the efficiency of random access of NB-IoT. The key mechanism of TARA is to conduct quick retries upon failure by exploiting the difference of time-alignment (TA) values in collided preambles. To analyze TARA rigorously, a theoretical model of TARA is derived, and its validity is verified via simulations. Further simulations are carried out to evaluate TARA with respect to different system parameters. Comparisons with existing schemes are also conducted. Both analytical and simulation results show that, under various system parameters, TARA achieves 30 percent higher success probability of random access, 75 percent higher throughput, and 40 percent lower access delay than the original slotted Aloha mechanism of NB-IoT.

One major challenge for this type of communication paradigm is to determine the identity of the transmitting nodes and the events. From previous works, we know that different amount of energy is discharged in the environment from different events. This motivates us to propose an energy-neutral event recognition framework using pulse position modulation in which the event information is transmitted by the sensors that use the energy harvested from the event. In this framework, we use pulse position to identify transmitting nodes communicating with a single receiver. However, using this approach, we can also encode the identity of multiple receivers when a single node communicates with them without employing an addressing scheme in IoNT networks. In both cases, the energy observation of the received pulse helps in identifying the event type. The feasibility of the proposed framework is demonstrated by a large number of numerical simulations which include terahertz channels. We find that the proposed framework achieves 99% accuracy for detecting ten different event types at a distance of 30 mm. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Energy harvesting; Energy-neutral; Internet of Nano-Things; Pulse Position Modulation","Internet of things; Pulse position modulation; Communication paradigm; Energy; Energy-neutral; Event recognition; Event Types; Fine grained; Internet of nano-thing; Know-that; Pulse positions; Pulse-position modulation; Energy harvesting",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124579493

Firstly, the image was transformed into HSV and RGB color subspaces through color space transformation, the color and texture features of apple diseases were extracted respectively.

However, numerous data acquisition and processing of sensors bring some privacy issues. Federated learning is a promising and privacy-friendly framework that trains a model across multiple devices or edge nodes holding local data samples without transferring their data to the server. It is not enough to protect privacy only by maintaining data locality, so differential privacy technology is often used to protect privacy in federated learning. However, different users have different privacy requirements, so it is inappropriate to use the same privacy protection scheme, assuming that all users trust or distrust the server. The former has poor accuracy, while the latter has poor privacy. This paper proposes a secure and reliable federated learning algorithm by integrating hybrid differential privacy into federated learning. We divide users into two categories according to their different privacy needs. In addition, we analyze the convergence and privacy bounds of the proposed algorithm and propose an adaptive gradient clip scheme and improved composition method to reduce the effects of noise and clip, respectively.

However, increasing complexity and dependency on third-party providers make it difficult to assess the security and privacy levels that distributed systems can offer to their users. In the last years, machine-readable Service Level Agreements (SLAs) have been studied as an optimal method for copying with security and privacy policies. Still, the computation of the SLAs of applications distributed in diverse infrastructures remains a challenging task. This paper presents a methodology to compose security SLAs (SecSLAs) and privacy SLAs (PLAs) of Cloud-based IoT applications on top of standard controls. The composition considers individual components’ SLAs and the control delegation relationships between the components with respect to different types of controls (common, system-specific or hybrid controls). Furthermore, we propose a technique to calculate the Service Level Objectives (SLO) of the controls declared in the composite SLA based on the SLOs granted by individual components.

To keep the connectivity of the constrained nodes upon topological changes, it is of vital importance to enhance the standard protocol stack, including the Routing Protocol for Lossy Low-power Networks (RPL), with accurate and real-time control decisions. We argue that devising a centralized mobility management solution based on a lightweight Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller provides seamless handoff with reasonable communication overhead. A centralized controller can exploit its global view of the network, computation capacity, and flexibility, to predict and significantly improve the responsiveness of the network. This approach requires the controller to be fed with the required input and to get involved in the distributed operation of the standard RPL. We present SDMob, which is a lightweight SDN-based mobility management architecture that integrates an external controller within a constrained IoT network. SDMob lifts the burden of computation-intensive filtering algorithms away from the resource-constrained nodes to achieve seamless handoffs upon nodes’ mobility. The current work extends our previous work, by supporting multiple mobile nodes, networks with a high density of anchors, and varying hop-distance from the controller, as well as harsh and realistic mobility patterns. Through analytical modeling and simulations, we show that SDMob outperforms the baseline RPL and the state-of-the-art ARMOR in terms of packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay, with an adjustable and tolerable overhead. With SDMob, the network provides close to 100% packet delivery ratio (PDR) for a limited number of mobile nodes, and maintains sub-meter accuracy in localization under random mobility patterns and varying network topologies. © 2022 by the authors.

It is then integrated with an Android application for displaying results in an user-friendly interface. Through the application, farmers can control the farm manually, or with a timer in minutes. The Machine Learning model predicts the suitable crops, in accordance with varying weather parameters. The application has a classified portal for farmers and customers to buy/sell directly, eliminating any involvement of mediators. One of the novelties in this research includes monitoring/controlling farm equipment and predicting field crops from a locally installed LCD display and keypad present in farmer's respective homes.

Failure to detect large-scale attacks like DDoS not only makes the networks vulnerable, but a failure of critical lifesaving medical and industrial equipment can also put human lives at risk. Lack of availability of comprehensive and quality network datasets and the narrow scope to build an IDS based on a single machine learning classifier adds further limitations. Such issues can risk producing inaccurate or biased results in the solutions proposed by various researchers. Toward this end, this paper analyzed several datasets (old, recent, non-IoT, and IoT specific) using several individual and hybrid deep learning classifiers. Our goal is to establish a benchmark that can compare several classification models on several datasets to limit (1) dataset quality issues and (2) possible bias in produced results. We reported our empirical results by revealing exciting findings on some of the classifiers, which took hours to converge but could not successfully detect attacks. In contrast, others quickly converged and were able to produce the best results in terms of accuracy and other performance metrics.

Fog computation is a popular paradigm that facilitates computation/storage facilities closer to the users and placed in between cloud environment and the users.

We propose two software agents: Software agent for Network formation and Monitoring (SAN) and Software agent for Blockchain formation and monitoring (SAB) placed in the fog node where SAN forms/monitors the network of IoT devices and SAB implements the security framework for blockchain implementation. Here, three different versions of AES (128/192/256) are used for group key sharing. Group key is used for encryption/decryption of the data present in a block of a blockchain. An AES 128 based Proof of Work (PoW) is used for block addition by an authorized IoT device. SHA 256 is used for implementing hashing in blockchain. Three different systems namely System 1, 2, and 3 are considered for the experiment under different settings of design parameters. A comparison between different settings is depicted in the result section. The execution time (in seconds) is used as an evaluation parameter.

More specifically, in addition to the TAM's main variables (i.e., perceived usefulness, ease of use, intention to use, real use), we investigate the roles of concepts rarely investigated in innovation and new technology research, such as well-being, social image, privacy concerns, and innovativeness. We also study the differences in the adoption of SCOs between different user adoption stages, such as the early adopters, early majority, and late majority (Rogers, 1983).

Structural equation modeling shows that the TAM variables remain relevant in the SCO context.

This technology works in the unlicensed ISM band and covers all the globe with different frequencies, which can improve the wide and rapid spread of information. To obtain global IoT coverage using LoRa, the use of satellite networks is mandatory. The development of nanosatellites, mostly in the CubeSat form factor, for communication applications in general and LoRa communication in particular, is currently increasing. To date, these satellites usually use linear wire deployable antennas for communication. However, deployable mechanical systems present the risk of failure during the mission. In fact, one-unit CubeSat geometry allows a very small space (10 cm * 10 cm * 0.06 cm) for the antenna. Since the size of the antenna is proportional to wavelengths, the antenna size is a large problem for low frequencies, especially in the UHF band. For this reason, planar antennas are an attractive solution for CubeSat communications. This work presents the design of a miniaturized printed monopole meander line antenna working at a frequency of 920 MHz. The novelty of the design is obtained by placing the meander line and the ground plane onto similar sides of the antenna. The meander line allows reduction of the antenna size by a factor of λ/5 for the selected operating frequency. The structure of this proposed antenna has a low profile, and a small size of 50 * 80 * 1.635 mm3 or about 0.153λ0 * 0.245 λ0.

That brings challenges to the energy management of the concerned modern buildings such as the data centers. Transient Thermal System Modeling (TTSM) is an essential solution to illustrate the instant thermal variation inside the buildings based on heat transformation prediction. TTSM can help plan, organize and optimize corresponding settings to improve energy efficiency. The adoption of row-based and rack-based structures as a cooling solution has recently emerged, especially boosted by its high efficiency. In contrast, few studies have concerned the related TTSM. In this study, we propose two frameworks exclusively targeting the TTSM of data centers that adopted row-based or rack-based cooling systems. A model-driven framework (MDF) and a data-driven framework (DDF) are developed, respectively. The MDF is expressed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), it is built based on the lumped-capacitance method under several pre-declared assumptions as a general TTSM solution to related structures. The DDF is developed as an extension of the Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) method to realize multivariate I/O (MIMO) predictions, which is commonly demanded in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. Both frameworks are evaluated experimentally on a physical cluster equipped with a high-level IIoT sensor measurement system. The guide for parameter-tuning of the model is also provided in the experiment part for use case analysing.

Thus, consensus measures of fuzzy values and consensus measures on fuzzy sets are both defined by aggregations, such as the arithmetic mean and the exponential mean. Based on the interval-valued fuzzy logic we consider inaccuracies related to the measurements beyond the uncertainties, modeling the imprecision of expertise in classifying a set of resources in the IoT based on the IT2FL-EXEHDA-RR Model.

During the malicious attacks, the removal of high degree nodes greatly affects the connectivity of the remaining nodes in the networks. Therefore, ensuring the maximum connectivity among the nodes is an important part of the topology optimization. A good scale-free network has the ability to maintain the functionality of the nodes even if some of them are removed from the network. Thus, designing a robust network to support the nodes’ functionality is the aim of topology optimization in the scale-free networks. Moreover, the computational complexity of an optimization process increases the cost of the network. Therefore, in this paper, the main objective is to reduce the computational cost of the network with the aim of constructing a robust network topology. Thus, four solutions are presented to reduce the computational cost of the network. First, a Smart Edge Swap Mechanism (SESM) is proposed to overcome the excessive randomness of the standard Random Edge Swap Mechanism (RESM). Second, a threshold based node removal method is introduced to reduce the operation of the edge swap mechanism when an objective function converges at a point. Third, multiple attacks are performed in the network to find the correlation between the measures, which are degree, betweenness and closeness centralities. Fourth, based on the third solution, a Heat Map Centrality (HMC) is used that finds the set of most important nodes from the network. The HMC damages the network by utilizing the information of two positively correlated measures. It helps to provide a good attack strategy for robust optimization. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SESM mechanism. It outperforms the existing RESM mechanism by almost 4% better network robustness and 10% less number of swaps. Moreover, 64% removal of nodes helps to reduce the computational cost of the network. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Betweenness centrality; Closeness centrality; Heat map centrality; Malicious attacks; Scale-free IoT networks","Cost reduction; Optimization; Topology; Betweenness centrality; Closeness centralities; Computational costs; Heat map centrality; Heat maps; Malicious attack; Scale free networks; Scale-free; Scale-free internet of thing network; Topology optimisation; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122353112

Existing ECN placement schemes consider redundant node density, non-optimal location selection, and distance-based association, which affect the ultra-low latency requirement(s) of applications. Further, per ECN to IoT nodes association is key to efficient utilization of ECNs and delay minimization between IoT node(s) and ECN. This work proposes a Cost-aware Edge Computational Node Placement (coECNP) scheme for optimal topology formation in EIaaS paradigm with the objective of IoT nodes delay minimization. It formulates ECN placement problem as a constrained optimization problem. Each iteration in the location discovery module of coECNP identifies optimal placement location by utilizing IoT node's density on an updated set of IoT nodes and hop-distance among previous iterations’ ECN locations and current candidate locations. As a result, it maximizes the number of IoT nodes that access ECN with minimum hop-distance, leading to end-to-end delay minimization. The assignment module of coECNP takes care of previously assigned nodes in each iteration before associating new IoT nodes to the nearest ECN to attain balanced mapping. Thus, it alleviates total delay from IoT node to respective ECN and enhances edge resource utilization to cater the application(s) near real-time execution requirement(s). The performance comparison indicates that coECNP achieves promising results by reducing IoT nodes delay by 23%–64%, 20%–66%, and 35%–73% on periodic, event-based, and query-based data traffic scenarios, respectively, under various network settings, compared to the benchmark solutions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Edge computing; Edge resource utilization; EIaaS paradigm; IoT; Topology formation","Benchmarking; Constrained optimization; Edge computing; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Location; Topology; Computational nodes; Cost-aware; Edge computing; Edge infrastructure-as-a-service paradigm; Edge resource utilization; Edge resources; Node placement; Resources utilizations; Service paradigm; Topology formation; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122262014

Therefore, cybersecurity in ICS becomes one of the most important issues. In this paper we propose a method for the design of algorithms for the detection of cyber-attacks on communication links between smart devices. The method belongs to the class of semi-supervised data driven approaches and it is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Starting from a predefined range of network hyperparameters and data obtained from system operation without attacks, the proposed method autonomously selects suitable CNN architecture and thresholds for online intrusion detection. Following the characteristics of ICS, the proposed intrusion detection is host based, and in our research we consider the structure of ICS and the feasibility of the attack detection algorithm implementation on control system devices. The method is experimentally verified using two case studies. In the first case study that refers to the publicly available dataset obtained from Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed, we present a comparative analysis of the developed method with alternative approaches. The second case study considers a custom developed electro-pneumatic positioning system; in this system we carry out the real-world implementation and validation of the intrusion detection algorithm developed using the proposed method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional neural networks; Cyber-attacks detection; Industrial control systems; Industrial internet-of-things; Industry 4.0","Computer crime; Control systems; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Cyber attacks; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Network security; Signal detection; Case-studies; Convolutional neural network; Cybe-attack detection; Cyber security; Detection algorithm; Industrial control systems; Intrusion-Detection; Network-based; Safety-Related; Smart devices; Crime",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121922460

The production of the high number of satellites involved in modern mega-constellations is bringing in the space industry the necessity of improved and optimized manufacturing approaches suitable for serial production, i.e., standard environment/high number of platforms. In this framework, the adoption of Industry 4.0 methodologies within the space industry will lead to a significant improvement and optimization of the whole Manufacturing Assembly Integration and Testing (MAIT) cycle. The main aim of Industry 4.0 is the creation of intelligent factories where manufacturing technologies are upgraded and transformed by Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics with predictive monitoring features. Main element of the Industry 4.0 approach is the synergic use of embedded sensing technologies in the frame of intelligent production processes, fostering a radical evolution of the industrial values chains, production value chains, and business models. In the present work, a possible application of the Industry 4.0 concepts to space industry is presented and discussed in terms of applicability and obtainable advantages.

Devices in many IoT applications are severely constrained in terms of computational resources and are thus unable to utilize many modern cryptographic methods for security purposes. Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) propose to solve this issue by allowing devices to generate unique and secure digital fingerprints at extremely low computational cost. However, PUFs are vulnerable to machine learning based modeling attacks that can mathematically clone the PUFs in order to impersonate them.

Wide applications are associated with a large amount of data transmission so that edge computing is inspired accordingly. In this research task, the major goal of edge computing is to handover a part of the computing work to the terminal equipment; the server only needs to process the results of final return. The IoT configuration proposed includes a perception layer, a transmission layer, and an application layer to fulfil a complete IoT system. In the perception layer, the facial authentication mechanism is adopted. This system is equipped with a highly robust anti-spoofing function, which can avoid criminal access from photos or electronic screens. Finally, the IoT transmission system is realised as the transmission layer. Combined with such a transmission mechanism, one can distribute user facial features to user's electronic devices instead of storing it in the server. This not only saves storage resources and transmission costs, but also allows users to complete data transmission and face authentication easily. © 2021 The Authors.

These pollutants can have devastating effects on human health, causing both acute and chronic diseases such as respiratory infections, lung cancer, and heart disease. Air pollution monitoring is vital not only to citizens, warning them on the health risks of air pollutants, but also to policy-makers, assisting them on drafting regulations and laws that aim at minimizing those health risks. Currently, air pollution monitoring predominantly relies on expensive high-end static sensor stations. These stations produce only aggregated information about air pollutants, and are unable to capture variations in individual's air pollution exposure. As an alternative, this article develops a citizen-based air pollution monitoring system that captures individual exposure levels to air pollutants during daily indoor and outdoor activities. We present a low-cost portable sensor and carry out a measurement campaign using the sensors to demonstrate the validity and benefits of citizen-based pollution measurements. Specifically, we (i) successfully classify the data into indoor and outdoor, and (ii) validate the consistency and accuracy of our outdoor-classified data to the measurements of a high-end reference monitoring station. Our experimental results further prove the effectiveness of our campaign by (i) providing fine-grained air pollution insights over a wide geographical area, (ii) identifying probable causes of air pollution dependent on the area, and (iii) providing citizens with personalized insights about air pollutants in their daily commute. © 2021 The Authors","Air pollution; Air quality; Data classification; Internet of things; Low-cost sensor; Wood smoke",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121660178

The algorithm runs in O(nlogn) time and O(n) space complexity, utilising enhanced suffix arrays and state-of-the-art construction techniques that enable the efficient detection of common segments between two firmware versions. Additionally, we propose an extension of the algorithm, which halves the storage requirements at the IoT device side (compared to other state-of-the-art approaches), so that devices with limited storage can also be efficiently re-programmed over-the-air.

A well-defined system paradigm and EA help enterprises in adopting appropriate manufacturing resources and technologies, optimizing plans, schedules, and controls of production lines, and coping with complexity, changes, and uncertainties of business processes cost-effectively. It is understandable that a system paradigm should be evolved along with the availability and advancement of advanced manufacturing technologies; on the other hand, new system paradigms are mostly inspired by some successful manufacturing applications of new information technologies (ITs). One of the recently developed system paradigms is Digital Manufacturing (DM) where Digital Twin (DT-I) is used to describe the interactions of virtual and physical entities. This paper discusses the concepts of DM and DT-I and rationalizes the relations of DM and DT-I; in particular, the origin and evolution of DT-I are explored in details to identify its limitations to be used as an EA for DM. It is our finding that existing IT concepts show their limitations in supporting smooth transitions when systems have to be reconfigured in dealing with long-term changes in Sustainable Manufacturing, and this is evidenced by the fact of the trend of the shortened lifespans of modern enterprises even with the aids of rapidly developed digital technologies in decades. To overcome these limitations, a new concept so called Digital Triad (DT-II) is coined and the Internet of Digital Triad Things (IoDTT) is proposed as an information integration (II) solution for digital manufacturing enterprises, and their application is illustrated through a reconfigurable robotic system example.

However, participating parties act selfishly in their interest resulting in a sub-optimal output for transactions. This makes it difficult for trust to be established and an effective equilibrium to be reached among parties. Therefore, it is essential to ensure coordination among all parties and for all parties to collaborate effectively to avoid this problem. This helps to create a favourable environment and ensures profitability on the supply chain. Previous works have attempted to achieve this by making use of contracting mechanisms to regulate IoT devices and nodes on the network. In these systems, parties are enticed to act in a way so that profit achieved in the supply chain is maximized. However, these contracting mechanisms utilized are centralized and can easily be compromised. Also, these contracts are not enforced by a framework that ensures the effective establishment of trust among parties on the supply chain. Also, equilibrium remains in-established due to the complexity and lack of an effective system to regulate behaviour effectively. In this work, we design a blockchain-adaptive framework that incentivizes participants to work together on the supply chain to establish an equilibrium. We show through a proof of Concept, that the blockchain possesses the necessary attributes needed in establishing a Nash Equilibrium and can be used to coordinate the supply chain in complex scenarios to ensure security, trust, and profit. Using game theory models, we develop novel approaches and prove mathematically that the blockchain is more efficient in establishing a supply chain equilibrium among parties, ensuring fairness among various parties. Additionally, we utilize smart contracts to calculate each participating party's expected payoff and profit. We also attempt to reduce the level of uncertainties across the supply chain by presenting profit-maximizing parties. Here the transparency provided by the blockchain provides a means to collate information relevant for making effective decisions on the blockchain which proves relevant in multi-complex supply chain networks such as aircraft, and vehicle manufacturing and assembling networks. Here, parties are thus incentivized to make the right decisions. We observe through our test that the blockchain provides all parties with the best payoff that satisfies all parties by incorporating each individual's decisions on the supply chain, ensuring trust and equilibrium are established.

This is not only because of the various aspects of IoT systems, such as software, hardware, and network that need to be tested, but also because of the unexpected issues caused by a large number of heterogeneous devices brought together by IoT systems. When an IoT system has hundreds, or even thousands, of heterogeneous devices, which devices should be tested to detect more faults? How can we systematically test an IoT system and its numerous devices in a cost-effective way? Are there any coverage criteria for testers to evaluate the thoroughness of the testing against IoT systems? In this paper, we present a combinatorial testing path selection framework for IoT systems, called CT-IoT, that systematically identifies and recommends testing paths in IoT systems for effective testing. We also propose four coverage criteria that can help testers evaluate the testing thoroughness for IoT systems. We conducted an empirical study of CT-IoT on two real-world IoT systems and evaluated the effectiveness of CT-IoT in terms of coverage achievements. The results show the superiority of CT-IoT over a random approach. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Combinatorial testing; Coverage criteria; Internet of things; IoT testing; Test case generation","Cost effectiveness; Software testing; Combinatorial testing; Cost effective; Coverage criteria; Heterogeneous devices; Internet of thing testing; Path selection; Selection framework; Software network; Software/hardware; Test case generation; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121308794

Results are shown for the operation of the WSN and how data can be acquired to build machine learning algorithms that can forecast the indoor conditions of a building, when the system is linked to an external weather station. Remarkably, our data indicates only minor degradation of the OPV when tested under indoor conditions over a 21-month period; at a luminance level of 1000 Lux, only a −10% relative drop in performance was measured.

Innovations made using technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, cloud computing and artificial intelligence are helping address this crisis. The urge for remote monitoring, symptom analysis and early detection of diseases lead to tremendous increase in the deployment of wearable sensor devices. They facilitate seamless gathering of physiological data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, respiration traces (RESP), galvanic skin response (GSR), pulse rate, body temperature, photoplethysmograms (PPG), oxygen saturation (SpO2) etc. For diagnosis and analysis purpose, the gathered data needs to be stored. Wearable devices operate on batteries and have a memory constraint. In mHealth application architectures, this gathered data is hence stored on cloud based servers. While transmitting data from wearable devices to cloud servers via edge devices, a lot of energy is consumed. This paper proposes a deep learning based compression model SCAElite that reduces the data volume, enabling energy efficient transmission. Results: Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers dataset and MIT-BIH dataset from PhysioNet are used for validation of algorithm performance. The model achieves a compression ratio of up to 300 fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the stress recognition dataset and 106.34-fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the MIT-BIH dataset. The computational complexity of SCAElite is 51.65% less compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model. Conclusion: It is experimentally validated that SCAElite guarantees a high compression ratio with good quality restoration capabilities for physiological signal compression in mHealth applications.

To realize the true potential of energy thrifty Internet-of-Things (IoT) objects, low power circuits and hence their low-voltage operating devices are a paramount prerequisite, especially when their power is constrained by autonomous energy scavenging. At present, through advanced manufacturing processes, silicon-based semiconductor devices are powering the modern electronics industry. However, processing temperatures are inhibiting them from flexible and printed electronics, as well as being too costly for scalability to the trillions of IoT objects anticipated. Therefore, development of solution-processed metal oxide semiconductors creates huge opportunities for IoT and wearables.

The operating voltage of the TFTs is ≤ 3 V with threshold voltage (Vth) 0.82 V, on/off ratio 105 and extracted mobility (μ) in saturation regime is 14.5 cm2/V·s.

The processing including data replication in traditional cloud computing often results in excessive resource utilization, performance overhead, and long response time. Fog computing has been proposed to overcome the shortcomings of cloud computing. Fog computing alleviates the processing and storage burden during data replication from the cloud to the network edge closer to sensor devices. Numerous data replica schemes in fog computing have been proposed to improve the performance efficiency of the data, reduce the turnaround delays of data access, and minimize network latency. However, these schemes do not consider data replication privacy, which is essential for data protection, reliability, and authentication. Therefore, this paper proposes a data replica creation scheme and a data replica placement scheme for preserving the privacy of data in fog computing. Our proposed replica creation scheme is based on a Level of Privacy (LoP) defined by data owners and the service capacity of fog nodes. Our proposed replica placement scheme is based on the priority level of fog nodes. We have conducted a comprehensive experimental analysis to compare the performance of our scheme and the existing schemes. Our results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly achieve efficient replicas privacy, prediction accuracy, as well as outperform the existing state-of-the-art schemes in terms of computational and memory costs. © 2021","Fog computing; Privacy; Replica creation; Replica placement; Service capacity","Data privacy; Digital storage; Fog; Internet of things; Cloud-computing; Data replica; Data replication; Performance; Placement scheme; Privacy; Privacy preserving; Replica creation; Replica placement; Service capacity; Fog computing",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118887696

It has improved the services of healthcare providers in delivering patient care. Even better, it has supported individuals that are suffering from a chronic condition in self-managing their condition. Patients diagnosed with diabetes are the leading beneficiaries of IoTMD, assisting them in maintaining their sugar level at a normal range. However, the security defense of these systems against potential cyberthreats is currently underdeveloped. Such threats must not be ignored as they can put the lives of the patients in danger. Thus, this paper proposes deep learning (DL)-based anomaly detection system composed of estimation and classification models applied to a subdomain in healthcare systems referred to as Diabetes Management Control System (DMCS). The estimation model was used to forecast the glucose level of patients at each evaluation time step, whereas the classification model is intended to detect anomalous data points. This paper implements convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms for comparison purposes. Moreover, considering that the dataset contains sensitive physiological information of the patients, this paper implements the independent learning (IL) and federated learning (FL) methods to maintain user data privacy. Furthermore, the post-quantization compression technique was also applied to convert models into their lightweight version, overcoming the computationally demanding processes of DL. Based on the experiment results, the FL method showed a higher recall rate (> = 98.69%) than the IL method (< = 97.87%). Additionally, the FL-aided CNN-based anomaly detection system performs better than the MLP-based approach. The former achieved an average recall rate of 99.24%, whereas the latter only attained 98.69%. Without loss of recall value, the inference latency of the models was tremendously reduced from more than 300 ms to less than two milliseconds when the original models were converted to their lightweight version. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence of things; Diabetes; Diabetes management; Federated learning; Intrusion detection system","Anomaly detection; Control systems; Data privacy; Deep learning; Health care; Internet of things; Multilayer neural networks; Patient monitoring; Anomaly detection systems; Artificial intelligence of thing; Classification models; Diabetes management; Estimation models; Federated learning; Intrusion Detection Systems; Learning methods; Management control system; Medical Devices; Intrusion detection",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118582276

It is a promising solution for telemonitoring systems that demand intensive data collection, for detection, classification, and prediction of future events, from different locations while maintaining a strict privacy constraint. Due to privacy concerns and critical communication bottlenecks, it can become impractical to send the FL updated models to a centralized server. Thus, this paper studies the potential of hierarchical FL in Internet of Things (IoT) heterogeneous systems. In particular, we propose an optimized solution for user assignment and resource allocation over hierarchical FL architecture for IoT heterogeneous systems. This work focuses on a generic class of machine learning models that are trained using gradient-descent-based schemes while considering the practical constraints of non-uniformly distributed data across different users. We evaluate the proposed system using two real-world datasets, and we show that it outperforms state-of-the-art FL solutions. Specifically, our numerical results highlight the effectiveness of our approach and its ability to provide 4–6% increase in the classification accuracy, with respect to hierarchical FL schemes that consider distance-based user assignment. Furthermore, the proposed approach could significantly accelerate FL training and reduce communication overhead by providing 75–85% reduction in the communication rounds between edge nodes and the centralized server, for the same model accuracy. © 2021 The Author(s)","Distributed deep learning; Edge computing; Intelligent health systems; Internet of Things (IoT); Non-IID data","Deep learning; Gradient methods; Hierarchical systems; Internet of things; Centralized server; Distributed deep learning; Edge computing; Health systems; Heterogeneous systems; IID data; Imbalanced data; Intelligent health system; Internet of thing; Non-IID data; Edge computing",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118559787

Clustering and dimensionality reduction in AIoT can facilitate efficient data management, storage, computing, and transmission of various data-driven AIoT applications. For high-efficiency data clustering and dimensionality reduction, this paper develops a prior-dependent graph (PDG) construction method to model and discover the complex relations of data. With the proper utilization and incorporation of data priors, i.e., (a) element local sparsity; (b) pair-wise symmetry; (c) multi-instance manifold smoothness; and (d) matrix low-rankness, the obtained graph has the characteristics of local sparsity, symmetry, low-rank, and can well reveal the complex multi-instance proximity among data points. The developed PDG model is then applied for two typical data analysis tasks, i.e., unsupervised data clustering and dimensionality reduction.

The internet of things (IoT) and many other mobile devices are another paradigm that has evolved lately and plays a significant role in communications. Smart healthcare has been a field of incredible change and growth in the age of smart houses, smart communities and the digital era. Technological expertise and electronics devices have fused, resulting in the internet of healthcare things (IoHT). It is considered to be one of the most required technological progress. However, the IoHT devices, wireless transmission of sensitive patient data poses some obvious security concerns. In addition, with the widespread use of IoHT devices, the foremost challenge is to manage and ensuring security while using IoHT for clinical applications. In this paper, the security and privacy challenges and associated threats in the domain of IoHT are thoroughly reviewed. A real-time collaborative jamming detection algorithm is proposed, which caters to all the significant challenges being faced. A jamming attack is a sub-type of denial of service (DoS) attack due to free Wi-Fi access points (APs) that executes on both mobile devices and Wi-Fi AP. The proposed algorithm investigates the strength of the received signal and the ratio of packet loss in the mobile devices, whereas the number of connected clients disrupted by the jammer is considered Wi-Fi AP. The approach aims to mitigate the causes of false alarms by connecting the originator present in the network, interfering with communication between the mobile devices and the Wi-Fi AP. This approach can be used to detect the presence of a jammer, which may hamper mobile device communication and prevent confidential information, that can be acquired via fake Wi-Fi AP. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","android security; healthcare IoT infrastructure jamming attack; mobile device privacy; mobile jamming; smartphone Wi-Fi","Android (operating system); Denial-of-service attack; Hospital data processing; Internet of things; mHealth; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Access points; Android securities; Healthcare internet of thing infrastructure jamming attack; Jammers; Jamming attacks; Mobile device privacy; Mobile jamming; Security vulnerabilities; Smart phones; Smartphone wi-fi; Jamming",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117947783

Privacy preserving keyword search, as one important secure technique, achieves search over encrypted cloud-based IoT data. Forward security and verifiability are two important security properties for privacy preserving keyword search for cloud-based IoT data. Forward security makes privacy preserving keyword search schemes for cloud-based IoT data able to resist file injection attack, which is one new attack on privacy preserving keyword search when IoT data is updated. Verifiability makes privacy preserving keyword search schemes for cloud-based IoT data able to ensure the validity of the search results returned by cloud. However, to the best of our knowledge, all of existing privacy preserving keyword search schemes at most achieve forward security and partial verifiability. In order to solve this problem, we explore how to simultaneously achieve the forward security and the full verification for intelligent encrypted data processing in cloud-based IoT and propose the first fully verifiable forward secure privacy preserving keyword search scheme for IoT outsourced data. In order to achieve forward security, we construct the secure index based on the hash chain. In each update, the IoT data owner randomly chooses a string as a new state to generate the new trapdoor. The new trapdoor cannot match previous trapdoors. In order to achieve the full verifiability while still maintaining forward security for intelligent encrypted data processing in cloud-based IoT, we design novel authentication construction called Forward Secure Accumulative Authentication Tag (FSAAT). This kind of tag has the incremental property and supports the verification on the basis of efficient data update.

How to collect and train the data securely has become the main problem to be resolved. Federated learning can combine a large amount of scattered data for training, and protect user data. Compared with general distributed learning, federated learning is more suitable for training on scattered data.

However, the SHA3 standard constrains and predefines the Keccak parameters to be used and thus making its use less flexible. In this paper we try to understand the influence of these parameters with respect to memory size and throughput, specifically for constrained devices used in the Internet of Things (IoT) where speed and efficiency is important.

Security aware routing is unceasing thought-provoking topic in IoT in the view of essential characteristics of IoT, notably multi-hop decentralized architecture, frequent topology change due to mobile IoT devices, lower link life, media access delay and multi-layer security threats. Additionally, there is need of cross layer routing that exploits dependency parameters between protocol layers as routing parameters to gain network performance through optimal routing decision. This paper introduces a design of secured cross layer protocol that utilizes routing parameters computed based on the exchanged information from Media Access Control (MAC) layer. Optimal routing decision considers various constraints like “distance, energy and Risk factor of path by Self Improved SLnO (SI-SLnO) algorithm”. We compute the Risk factor for each optimal path.

Thanks to its ability to remove the long-term trends from a set of variables of the same process, cointegration, a technique born in the field of econometrics, has been introduced about ten years ago in SHM applications as a valid method to project out the confounding influences, such as environmental and operational variations. Because of the few examples of implementation currently available, this paper provides an in-depth review of all the relevant aspects to consider when cointegration is used as damage detection strategy and data are acquired from real-world structures of large dimensions. The methodology is applied for the first time on a complex structure of a singular nature, i.e. the steel roof of the G. Meazza stadium in Milan, which consists of multiple modular elements referred to as rafts. The time series which measures the rotations of the rafts are used as input data for the development of the cointegration-based method. Then, Johansen procedure is adopted to create a unique feature from the multivariate dataset, namely cointegrating residual, in which the effects of environmental and operational variables are suppressed, while the effects due to damage remain evident. The obtained residual is therefore used for novelty detection by means of a control chart, demonstrating its effectiveness into identifying the presence of anomalies or modifications in the structure in a clear and timely manner. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cointegration; Environmental and operational variation; Large structures; Non-stationary time series; Novelty detection; Structural health monitoring","Anomaly detection; Damage detection; Internet of things; Roofs; Time series; Time series analysis; Traffic surveys; Anomaly detection; Automatic evaluation; Cointegration; Environmental and operational variation; Health state; Large structures; Large-scale structure; Non-stationary time series; Novelty detection; Real-world; Structural health monitoring",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116042554

The hysteresis in the STM curve of the CNFET Schmitt SRAM has been achieved through proper adjustment of the threshold voltage Vth of the different CNFETs used to implement the SRAM. The Vth of the CNFET can be set to the required level by selecting the appropriate chiral vectors of the CNFET. The CNFET based SRAM consumes merely 3.2 pW of power as compared to 19.5 pW of power required by the same SRAM implemented with MOSFET devices. The CNFET SRAM also has an average propagation delay of 31 ps, which is significantly lower than the delay of 250 ns experienced in CMOS-based SRAM. A simplified multi-Vth 6T CNFET SRAM design is also proposed, which consumes merely 0.1 pW of power, thus enabling a 99% reduction in total power consumption in contrast to the conventional CMOS SRAM design. The device characteristics of the CNFET has been benchmarked with 45 nm CMOS devices.

Particularly, to achieve effective AD detection, ADDetector only collects user's audio by IoT devices widely deployed in the smart home environment and utilizes novel topic-based linguistic features to improve the detection accuracy. For the privacy breach existing in data, feature, and model levels, ADDetector achieves privacy-preserving by employing a unique three-layer (i.e., user, client, cloud, etc.) architecture. Moreover, ADDetector exploits federated learning (FL) based scheme to ensure the user owns the integrity of raw data and secure the confidentiality of the classification model and implement differential privacy (DP) mechanism to enhance the privacy level of the feature.

While the sequenced packets are executed sequentially on the target IoT device, the remaining packets, which are currently not being operated on, distribute and keep looping over the network links until they are required for processing. A time-synchronized packet deflection mechanism on each node handles data transfer and looping of individual packets.

Meanwhile, sparse tensor factorization (STF) is a useful tool for dimension reduction to analyze high-order, high-dimension, and sparse tensor (HOHDST) data, which is transmitted on 5G Internet-of-things (IoT). Hence, HOHDST data relies on STF to obtain complete data and discover rules for real time and accurate analysis. From another view of computation and data security, the current STF solution seeks to improve the computational efficiency but neglects privacy security of the IoT data, e.g., data analysis for network traffic monitor system. To overcome these problems, this article proposes a multiple-strategies differential privacy framework on STF (MDPSTF) for HOHDST network traffic data analysis. MDPSTF comprises three differential privacy (DP) mechanisms, i.e., varepsilon - DP, concentrated DP, and local DP. Furthermore, the theoretical proof of privacy bound is presented. Hence, MDPSTF can provide general data protection for HOHDST network traffic data with high-security promise. We conduct experiments on two real network traffic datasets (Abilene and Ggrave{E}ANT). The experimental results show that MDPSTF has high universality on the various degrees of privacy protection demands and high recovery accuracy for the HOHDST network traffic data. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Differential privacy framework; multiple-strategies privacy protection; network traffic analysis; sparse tensor factorization","5G mobile communication systems; Computational efficiency; Data privacy; Factorization; Information analysis; Network security; Tensors; Accurate analysis; Differential privacies; Dimension reduction; Electronic infrastructure; Fast transmissions; Internet of Things (IOT); Network traffic analysis; Privacy protection; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107176585

Therefore, how to make full use of precious cases while not leaking out patients' privacy is a leading and promising work especially in future privacy-preserving intelligent medical period. In this article, we investigate how to securely invoke patients' records from past case-database while protecting the privacy of both current diagnosed patient and the case-database and construct a privacy-preserving medical record searching scheme based on ElGamal Blind Signature. In our scheme, by blinded the healthy data of the patient and the database of the iDoctor, respectively, the patient can securely make self-helped medical diagnosis by invoking past case-database and securely comparing the blinded abstracts of current data and previous records. Moreover, the patient can obtain target searching information intelligently at the same time he knows whether the abstracts match or not instead of obtaining it after matching. It greatly increases the timeliness of information acquisition and meets high-speed information sharing requirements, especially in 5G era. What's more, our proposed scheme achieves bilateral security, that is, whether the abstracts match or not, both of the privacy of the case-database and the private information of the current patient are well protected. Besides, it resists different levels of violent ergodic attacks by adjusting the number of zeros in a bit string according to different security requirements. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","ElGamal blind signature; intelligent medical diagnosis; privacy-preserving medical record searching system","Abstracting; Database systems; Internet of things; Privacy by design; Blind signatures; Disease diagnosis; Information acquisitions; Intelligent diagnosis; Privacy preserving; Private information; Security requirements; Target searching; Diagnosis",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103778353

Through on-demand search queries, data are shared with third-party healthcare service providers to monitor patients' health status and provide timely diagnoses. To ensure privacy and security, patient health data should be encrypted before being uploaded to the cloud. The cloud can give search encryption services. However, current searchable encryption (SE) technologies still have problems with forward privacy security and verifiability. This article proposes an IoT-cloud-enabled healthcare data system incorporating a SE method with forward privacy and verifiability. By designing a trapdoor permutation function, we render the resulting output indistinguishable from meaningless random data to the adversary. Thus, the adversary cannot judge the relationship between a newly inserted record and a past search token, and therefore, the system realizes forward privacy or forward secrecy. We propose a multikeyword search verification mechanism based on a pseudo-random function. Our approach solves verifying the correctness of search results in the top-k search scenario with partial search results. A formal security analysis proves that our scheme achieves forward privacy preservation, which can help guarantee healthcare data privacy. Additionally, a performance evaluation shows that our method is efficient and effective, providing an information security system to preserve patient privacy in IoT-enabled healthcare systems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Forward privacy; healthcare systems, Internet of Things (IoT); privacy preservation","Cryptography; Health care; Privacy by design; Dynamic changes; Formal security analysis; Health-care system; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Searchable encryptions; Smart healthcare systems; Trapdoor permutations; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102645100

The flexibility can come from different choices of underlying algorithms along with suitable parameter choices. A software implementation offers better flexibility but lacks in timing performance, whereas custom hardware delivers better performance but has poor flexibility. Furthermore, the designs over small characteristic curves are now insecure against recent attacks. Existing designs do not address the drawback of less flexibility and huge resource consumption collectively. In this article, we present a micro-program controlled hardware design which has the least resource consumption among the similar existing designs on FPGA that offer such programmability and flexibility. This redundant number arithmetic-based architecture consumes only 2506 slices on Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. It can be migrated to other device families or updated for different algorithms without data-path or control-path modification.

The system consists of two sections: the digital one, based on the National Instruments MyRIO, digitalises the signal and processes it in real-time to make a diagnosis on possible occurring cardiac pathologies (bradycardia, tachycardia, infarction, ischemia); the analog section, which performs the acquisition, amplification, and preliminary filtering of a 3-leads electrocardiographic signal. The processing algorithm has been developed in NI LabVIEW environment. The main contribution to the state of the art is due to two removable and updatable memory devices. A first memory has been used to store clinical and personal data of patient so to configure the computing algorithm and adapt it to the monitored patient. A second memory has been used to store accuracy and uncertainty specifications of the ECG system in order to improve the reliability of the final diagnosis.

Currently, data trading systems have many drawbacks, as they involve a third party, security and reputation mechanisms. Therefore, in this article, IoTs and BlockChain (BC) are integrated to monetize IoT's data and provide trustful data trading.

The review system encourages the owners to provide authentic data and solves the issues regarding data integrity, fake reviews and conflicts between entities. Reviews and ratings are stored in the BC database for providing a guarantee about the data quality to users. To maintain data integrity, we use an advanced encryption standard (AES)-256 encryption technique to encrypt data. Moreover, an arbitrator entity is responsible to resolve conflicts between data owner and users. The incentive is provided to the users and arbitrators to increase user participation and honesty.

While some traffic classification applications (e.g. QoS based path allocation) can tolerate delays, other applications (e.g. attack detection) are time critical. In this context, early traffic classification has been proposed based on the first few packets of flows. However, the choice of the number of packets to inspect is method dependent and based on empirical assessment without considering the information carried by these packets (features). In this paper, we aim at identifying the sufficient number of packets, N, that guarantees high classification accuracy while optimizing the response time, based on both empirical classification results and information theory. We propose a confidence measure based on the variations in the model training accuracy and the average mutual information among the packets’ features and the label vector. This measure is then used to define the value of N, which optimizes the trade-off between the time overhead and the classification accuracy. In addition, we propose an ensemble Deep Learning (DL)-based classifier model to enhance the classification accuracy by training successive DL models based on the traffic stream. The proposed ensemble method output is based on the average of the individual classifiers predictions. The experimental results show that when using the proposed confidence measure, we can achieve good classification accuracy at early phase of the flow. In addition, using the proposed ensemble method presents enhancement in the early classification accuracy. Consequently, combining the ensemble method with the confidence measure criteria allows for striking a good balance between high accuracy and fast response time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Internet of Things; Internet traffic; Real-time classification; Traffic classification; Traffic management","Deep learning; Economic and social effects; Information theory; Internet of things; Quality of service; Classification accuracy; Confidence Measure; Ensemble methods; Internet traffic; Quality-of-service; Real- time; Real-time classification; Realtime traffic; Traffic classification; Traffic management; Classification (of information)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123234833

Their vulnerability to malware has motivated the need for efficient techniques to detect infected IoT devices inside networks. With data privacy and integrity becoming a major concern in recent years, increasing with the arrival of 5G and Beyond networks, new technologies such as federated learning and blockchain emerged. They allow training machine learning models with decentralized data while preserving its privacy by design. This work investigates the possibilities enabled by federated learning concerning IoT malware detection and studies security issues inherent to this new learning paradigm. In this context, a framework that uses federated learning to detect malware affecting IoT devices is presented. N-BaIoT, a dataset modeling network traffic of several real IoT devices while affected by malware, has been used to evaluate the proposed framework. Both supervised and unsupervised federated models (multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder) able to detect malware affecting seen and unseen IoT devices of N-BaIoT have been trained and evaluated. Furthermore, their performance has been compared to two traditional approaches. The first one lets each participant locally train a model using only its own data, while the second consists of making the participants share their data with a central entity in charge of training a global model. This comparison has shown that the use of more diverse and large data, as done in the federated and centralized methods, has a considerable positive impact on the model performance. Besides, the federated models, while preserving the participant's privacy, show similar results as the centralized ones. As an additional contribution and to measure the robustness of the federated approach, an adversarial setup with several malicious participants poisoning the federated model has been considered. The baseline model aggregation averaging step used in most federated learning algorithms appears highly vulnerable to different attacks, even with a single adversary. The performance of other model aggregation functions acting as countermeasures is thus evaluated under the same attack scenarios. These functions provide a significant improvement against malicious participants, but more efforts are still needed to make federated approaches robust. © 2022 The Authors","Adversarial attack; Botnet detection; Federated learning; IoT device; IoT security","5G mobile communication systems; Botnet; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Malware; Network security; Privacy-preserving techniques; Adversarial attack; Botnet detections; Centralised; Federated learning; IoT device; IoT security; Malicious participant; Malware detection; Model aggregations; Performance; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122584894

In a clone node attack, an adversary aims to physically capture the secret credentials of the deployed IoT devices to make the clone of devices look similar to the original devices. In recent years, several solutions for detecting clone node attacks have been designed; however, the focus of such designed solutions is on system design discussion, specific feature sets, high-level abstraction of underlying system architecture and fulfilling the performance analysis requirements. While the designed solutions efficiently detect clone attacks, critical features such as modelling, analysis, and verification of such solutions are frequently overlooked, necessitating that users verify their internal behaviour and claimed properties to ensure that no problematic scenarios or anomalies exist. Taking into account the rationale for formal verification and the limitations of previous works, this paper aims to perform formal modelling, analysis, and verification of our existing proposed clone node attack detection scheme for IoT. We used the High-Level Petri Nets (HLPNs) and Z-specification language to model our proposed scheme and analyse the logic correctness of our scheme using incidence markings and confidence interval matrices. To validate the functional correctness, we utilised the Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library (SMT-Lib) and the Z3 Solver and verified the functional satisfiable properties by analysing sat/unsat verification results and their execution time. Finally, we extend our modelling work by utilising the Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs), taking into consideration their both timed and untimed models with the aim of validating functional correctness and logical correctness, respectively.

A successful integration of new IT such as Blockchain technology and Internet of Things (IoT) can lead to several advantages in order to help asbestos waste management.

There are many possible applications, in fields as smart cities, home automation, smart buildings, agriculture, automated metering, logistic, industrial automation, among others. Such a wide range of applications resulted in various technological solutions in order to enable Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, in which we highlight those for wide area networks. In that sense, two widely used sub-GHz protocols for Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) communications are: Long Range (LoRa), using the upper layers defined by Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN); and IEEE 802.15.4g, using the upper layers defined by IPv6 over the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6TiSCH). While LoRaWAN is a well-known and widespread protocol, 6TiSCH offers IPv6 connectivity to LPWA networks and is used in important standards such as Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Network (Wi-SUN). This paper aims at determining how well each protocol scales, analyzing different aspects such as packet loss, delay, and the maximum number of nodes per square area. In order to achieve such results, computer simulations are performed using open-source simulators. The obtained results demonstrate that the best scalability depends on which scenarios are considered. For scenarios with multiple gateways requiring low latency or low packet transmission rates, LoRaWAN demonstrates better results. However, in scenarios with high packet transmission rates and where the latency is not a major concern, 6TiSCH is more appropriate. Moreover, even in the best case, the latency associated with the LoRaWAN technology may be considerably smaller than associated with 6TiSCH. Such novelty results are obtained in a fair and realistic way and, noting that both technologies could be used to build LPWA networks, it can help system designers to decide between the two technologies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","6LoWPAN; 6TiSCH; LoRaWAN; Simulation; TSCH","Automation; IEEE Standards; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Low power electronics; Packet networks; Titanium compounds; 6LoWPAN; 6TiSCH; Channel hopping; Long range wide area network; Low Power; Simulation; Slotted channels; Time-slotted channel hopping; Upper layer; Wide-area networks; Wide area networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122451542

The proposed framework adopts a high level of authentication and user services through unanimous keying and allocations. This process is defined within the framework covering the service provider and end-users. In this authentication, hyper-elliptic curve cryptography is exploited for service authentication, whereas the key distribution follows a discrete allocation process. Here the discreteness and continuity in authentication are determined using regression learning. The change in distribution function determines the authentication level and redeeming security for further service disseminations. Therefore, the regression sequence is modified without augmenting additional keys in a pervasive manner.

Using both approaches, the central station and the coordinating agent play critical roles, resulting in low robustness. A novel fully distributed approach may offer higher robustness, but has not yet been investigated for HVAC systems. This paper therefore proposes a fully distributed optimal control approach for multi-zone dedicated outdoor air systems (DOASs) to be implemented in IoT-enabled building automation networks. Without the coordinating agent, information is exchanged directly between connected agents. The optimal solutions are found by coordinating these multiple agents. During iterations, the outdoor air volume of individual rooms and the PAU are optimized locally using the Incremental Cost Consensus (ICC) algorithm, and the outdoor air volume mismatch is estimated locally using the average consensus algorithm. Tests are conducted to validate the proposed approach by comparing it with existing approaches. The impacts of communication topology on the performance of the proposed approach are investigated. Results show that the proposed fully distributed optimal control approach with the fully connected topology performs better than the existing hierarchical distributed approach. Among different communication topologies, the proposed approach with the fully connected topology had the highest robustness, lowest computation complexity and highest optimization efficiency.

Moreover, the proposed technique provides further flexibility for self-aware CPSs to dynamically adjust the number of data samples that are needed for processing (and consequently reduce the power consumption) based on the application at hand and the desired trade-off between accuracy and power consumption.

Encryption provides an effective and important means of protecting data privacy in the IoT. Because of resource limitations, to achieve high efficiency IoT devices require an encryption scheme that ensures that the encryption phase does not incur a heavy data transmission overhead. By virtue of its many advantages, the use of public-key encryption in current applications is widespread. Identity-based public-key encryption (IBE) removes the obstacle raised by the sophisticated certificate management required by other schemes, and its efficiency renders it more suitable for application in the IoT.

Elements in the system, such as sensors and actuators, can exchange encrypted data directly or via a cloud server. If a private key is compromised, the private key generator can revoke its user.

The concept of Society 5.0 pioneers an abstract system unifying different smart environments (SEs) to provide seamless services to the citizens. While serving different applications, these SEs store users' information in the cloud engendering users' privacy. CP-ABE is one of the conventional security systems that preserves privacy with group data accessibility. Contemporary CP-ABE solutions enforce users to manually provide their contextual information, namely, attributes, to encrypt/decrypt data. From these solutions it can be conjectured that incorrect attribute selection by a user raises the issue of unauthenticated access to information. To address these issues, we propose a scheme, named the context-aware attribute learning scheme (CASE), which autonomously learns users' contextual information, exploiting edge intelligence, generates attributes, and reduces the post-encryption data size using the learned attributes. We examine the performance of CASE with the help of a case study on CP-ABE over smart healthcare systems (SHSs).

For successful integration of UAV relays in IoT networks, efficient radio resource management (RRM) is critical. We developed a multicriterion framework for energy-efficient RRM in a cooperative IoT network. We considered UAVs as relays, onboard EH facilities and deployed to relay the messages from a satellite terminal to the network IoT devices. We adopted a power splitting (PS)-based EH scheme, i.e., PS relaying protocol, for RF-EH at UAV relays. We formulate a joint optimization problem for IoT device selection, UAV relay assignment, source power allocation, and PS ratio selection. In our multicriterion framework, we consider three conflicting objectives by applying a weighted-sum method: 1) maximizing the network sum rate; 2) maximizing the number of IoT devices to be served; and 3) minimizing the carbon dioxide emissions. We propose an outer approximation algorithm (OAA) to solve the formulated problem, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. Simulation results of the proposed algorithm are compared with two existing solutions, namely, the nonlinear optimization by mesh adaptive direct search (NOMAD) algorithm and an evolutionary algorithm (EA). The performance of the NOMAD algorithm is better in terms of computational complexity. However, the simulation results reveal the supremacy of the proposed OAA in terms of network sum rate, the number of selected IoT devices, and network utility. © 2014 IEEE.","Cooperative communication (CC); energy harvesting (EH); Internet of Things (IoT); optimization; power splitting (PS); relay assignment (RA); unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Antennas; Approximation algorithms; Carbon dioxide; Cooperative communication; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Evolutionary algorithms; Global warming; Integer programming; Natural resources management; Nonlinear programming; Resource allocation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Carbon dioxide emissions; Conflicting objectives; Mesh adaptive direct search; Mixed integer non-linear programming problems; Non-linear optimization; Outer approximation algorithm; Radio resource management; RF energy harvesting; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112610423

To assure the quality-of-service demand by the users, the edge computing paradigm of 5G networks can be incorporated in the IoV environment for supporting compute-intensive applications. The basic safety messages are typically transmitted using a multicast pattern in the IoV-enabled edge computing paradigm. The use of the multicast channel may accelerate the communication process; however, it is prone to various attacks due to the open nature of wireless networks. This article proposes a multimessage and multireceiver signcryption scheme for the multicast channel in a certificateless setting to solve the key escrow problem. The security of the partial private key is dependent on the secure channel, which increases the complexities of the system. Therefore, in the proposed scheme, we introduce a new idea that does not require a secure channel. The key generation center only sends the pseudo partial private key of the users on a public channel. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is based on hyper-elliptic curve cryptography (HECC), which has much smaller key sizes as compared to elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).

The primary aim of our proposed work is to reduce the total number of sensor nodes required to generate safety-related decisions, which minimizes both energy and time consumption. Further, the requested DQs are processed and a decision is generated in three different stages. First, the DQs are categorized as emergency decision query (EDQ) and nonemergency decision query (NEDQ), depending upon the type of vehicle from where the end-users have requested safety services. The EDQs and NEDQs are mapped with the stored decisions present in the database of the decision virtualization layer during the second level. In case of mismatch with the stored decisions in the database, EDQs are directly executed from the sensor nodes deployed at a particular geographical location or into the vehicles, in the device layer of the Safe-aaS infrastructure. In the third level, the similarity score of NEDQs, which do not match with the parameters of the stored decisions, is computed. Based on the number of similar decision parameters present in them, the similarity score is computed.

However, the similarity-based method is not sufficiently accurate, whereas the offline training of the neural network-based method is overly time consuming. An efficient model with high positioning accuracy is therefore not yet available. We propose a stacking ensemble broad learning localization system using channel state information as a fingerprint, which is termed EnsemLoca. A bootstrapping method is used to build the training set, which enables the EnsemLoca system to build the base learner in parallel by using bagging. The broad learning system (BLS), which is a novel neural network model, as a base learner, not only has the advantage of time complexity but also offers a sparse representation in which the features are filtered. A unique base learner is constructed by randomly selecting the samples and features, and they are combined by stack generalization. The experimental results show that the EnsemLoca system achieves higher accuracy than several machine-learning algorithms in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS environments, and is even stronger than deep neural networks characterized by accuracy. At the same time, it has the same theoretical complexity as BLS, which greatly reduces the offline training time. © 2014 IEEE.","Broad learning system (BLS); Channel state information (CSI); Intelligent localization; Internet of Things","Channel state information; Complex networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Indoor positioning systems; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Software engineering; Bootstrapping method; Fingerprint Recognition; Non-line-of-sight environments; Novel neural network; Positioning accuracy; Similarity-Based Methods; Sparse representation; Theoretical complexity; Learning systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110791175

While the 6LoWPAN adaptation-layer standard provides resource-efficient IPv6 compatibility to low-power wireless networks, the basic 6LoWPAN design does not include security and privacy features. A resource-efficient authenticated key exchange (AKE) scheme becomes imperative for 6LoWPAN-based resource-constrained networks to render indecipherable communication functionality. This article presents a lightweight user AKE scheme for 6LoWPAN-based SH networks (LAKE-6SH) to achieve authenticity of RUs and establish private session keys between the users and network entities by employing the SHA-256 hash function, exclusive-OR operation, and a simple authenticated encryption primitive. Informal security validation illustrates that LAKE-6SH is protected against different pernicious security attacks. The security is further validated formally through the random oracle model. Moreover, through Scyther validation, it is demonstrated that LAKE-6SH is secure.

Such brilliant automation of mundane tasks requires a considerable amount of user data in digital format, which, in turn, makes IoT networks an open source of personally identifiable information data for malicious attackers to steal, manipulate, and perform nefarious activities. A huge interest has been developed over the past years in applying machine learning (ML)-assisted approaches in the IoT security space. However, the assumption in many current works is that big training data are widely available and transferable to the main server because data are born at the edge and are generated continuously by IoT devices. This is to say that classic ML works on the legacy set of entire data located on a central server, which makes it the least preferred option for domains with privacy concerns on user data. To address this issue, we propose the federated-learning (FL)-based anomaly detection approach to proactively recognize intrusion in IoT networks using decentralized on-device data. Our approach uses federated training rounds on gated recurrent units (GRUs) models and keeps the data intact on local IoT devices by sharing only the learned weights with the central server of FL. Also, the approach's ensembler part aggregates the updates from multiple sources to optimize the global ML model's accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the classic/centralized machine learning (non-FL) versions in securing the privacy of user data and provides an optimal accuracy rate in attack detection. © 2014 IEEE.","Federated learning (FL); gated recurrent units (GRUs); Internet of Things (IoT); recurrent neural networks (RNNs); security","Anomaly detection; Data privacy; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Attack detection; Detection approach; Human intervention; Internet of thing (IOT); Optimal accuracy; Personally identifiable information; Physical devices; Privacy concerns; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105874470

Thus, in this study, our focus is to establish a secured connection in a multiple-antenna transmission when the channel state information (CSI) of Eve is unknown to the network users.

With respect to this and in attempt to realize maximum privacy, we examined the design of optimal jamming parameters.

In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), most ML-enabled IDS approaches use centralized approaches where IoT devices share their data with data centers for further analysis. To mitigate privacy concerns associated with centralized approaches, in recent years the use of Federated Learning (FL) has attracted a significant interest in different sectors, including healthcare and transport systems. However, the development of FL-enabled IDS for IoT is in its infancy, and still requires research efforts from various areas, in order to identify the main challenges for the deployment in real-world scenarios. In this direction, our work evaluates a FL-enabled IDS approach based on a multiclass classifier considering different data distributions for the detection of different attacks in an IoT scenario. In particular, we use three different settings that are obtained by partitioning the recent ToN_IoT dataset according to IoT devices’ IP address and types of attack. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of different aggregation functions according to such setting by using the recent IBMFL framework as FL implementation. Additionally, we identify a set of challenges and future directions based on the existing literature and the analysis of our evaluation results. © 2021 The Author(s)","Federated Learning; Internet of Things; Intrusion detection systems","Classification (of information); Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Centralized approaches; Cyber security; Detection process; Efficient detection; Federated learning; Intrusion Detection Systems; Intrusion-Detection; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Systems approach; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121903251

This work focuses on the interaction between possibly mobile sensors and actuators in such IoT regimes which deploy the Named-Data Networking (NDN) architecture. Constrained nodes in interactive scenarios need to be highly responsive but can only manage limited control state. We argue that the request-driven NDN networking paradigm, which prevents pushing of unsolicited data, should be preserved to confine the attack surface, whereas unsolicited link-local signaling can accelerate responses without sacrificing security. In this paper, we contribute HoP-and-Pull (HoPP), a robust publish–subscribe scheme for typical IoT scenarios that targets low-power and lossy wireless networks running hundreds of resource constrained devices at intermittent connectivity. Our approach limits in-memory forwarding state to a minimum and naturally supports producer mobility, a temporary partitioning of networks, data aggregation on intermediary hops, and near real-time reactivity. We thoroughly evaluate the protocol by experiments in a realistic, large testbed with varying numbers of constrained devices, each interconnected via IEEE 802.15.4 wireless LoWPANs. We compare HoPP with common ICN pub–sub and mobility schemes as well as with basic MIPv6 and anchor-based multicast mobility.

For example, the Mirai botnet infected almost 65,000 devices in its first 20 h. With the prevalence of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phones and devices on the networks today, the attacker could easily target and recruit these IoT devices as bots. Conventional network security measures do not provide adequate attack prevention, detection, and mitigation for these widely distributed IoT devices. This paper presents microVNF, a Virtualized Network Function (VNF) that leverages the programmable data plane feature on the edge switch. Based on knowledge gained from the Mirai botnet incident and following the defense-in-depth principle, microVNF protects IoT devices against SIP DDoS attacks in two stages: before and after infection. Prior to infection, it protects against SIP scanning, enumeration, and dictionary attacks. After infection, microVNF blocks botnet registration attempts to the command-and-control (CNC) server, thereby preventing the botnet from receiving commands sent from the CNC server, and detects and mitigates botnet SIP DDoS attacks. We conducted six experiments that involved using popular attack tools against microVNF, and it successfully performed deep-packet inspection of unencrypted SIP packets so as to track anomalies from a typical SIP state-machine. In this use case, besides providing physical connectivity to the IoT devices, the edge switch containing microVNF also provides the first line of defense in stopping malicious packets from propagating upstream to the core network. In addition to securing SIP, the microVNF approach can be adapted to other text-based, application-layer protocols such as HTTP and SMTP. MicroVNF leverages the native capability of programmable data planes without depending on external devices, thereby making this approach practical for securing edge-computing environments against application-layer attacks. © 2021","DDoS; Dictionary attack; Edge computing; IoT; P4; SIP; SIPVicious; VNF","Botnet; Denial-of-service attack; Edge computing; Internet protocols; Network security; Botnets; Data planes; Data-plane; DDoS; Dictionary attack; Edge computing; Network functions; Session Initiation Protocols; Sipvicious; Virtualized network function; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121325094

Although recent research argues that digital technology can enable new kinds of development processes that are distinctive from their counterparts in the 20th century, minimal attention has been focused on the IoT design process. In order to contextualize New Product Development (NPD) processes for IoT, this paper comprehensively interrogates existing, and emerging development approaches for products, services, software, and integrated products, and several factors that affect designing IoT. This discussion includes the generic development process, the commonalities and differences of different development approaches, and processes. The paper demonstrates that only a few existing approaches reflect vital characteristics of networked artifacts or the integration of data science within the development model, which is one of the key attributes of IoT design. From these investigations, we propose The Mobius Strip Model of IoT Development ProcessI, a conceptual process for IoT design, which is distinctive to others. The continuous loops of the IoT design integrate the attributes and phases of different processes and consist of two different development approaches and strategies. Understanding the particular attributes of the IoT NPD process can help novice and experienced researchers in both feeding and drawing insight from the broader design discourse.

Current smart sensors are mostly powered by lithium batteries, and it is necessary to develop a new self-powered device that can replace traditional lithium batteries. This paper designs a maglev electromagnetic-triboelectric hybrid energy converter (METHEC) containing both a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and an electromagnetic generator (EMG), which can effectively collect low-frequency vibrational energy. This paper presents a complete device design and optimization system based on theoretical calculation and simulation verification, and establishes a test platform capable of evaluating the dynamic characteristics of METHEC and thus conducts some experiments for validation. In the past, the TENG related to vertical vibration only possessed the test part, and the current was less than 1 μA, with the power still less than 1 mW even with a large triboelectric area. Additionally, there is no complete research system for devices that utilize vertical vibration. The traditional EMG has a large starting torque, a large volume and can only be applied to higher frequencies, which is not convenient for wide application, and the power rarely exceeds 100 mW. According to this study, excited by the vibrational motion at a frequency of 5.2 Hz, the open-circuit voltages of TENG and EMG are 7.5 V and 9 V, respectively; the short-circuit currents of TENG and EMG are 1.1 μA and 87.7 mA, respectively; and the maximum power density of TENG reaches 7.5 mW m-2, while the peak power of EMG reaches 789.3 mW. This paper provides a complete set of innovative exploration systems combining theory, experiment and simulation optimization, which also includes the structural optimization of TENG. METHEC does not require a large starting torque and can also be adapted to low frequencies, and can thus be adapted to more environments. Compared with traditional EMG, METHEC makes it easier to realize the miniaturization of power generation equipment, and according to this research system, other models can be studied expansively.

With Industry 4.0 being unable to address and meet increased drive of personalization, the term Industry 5.0 was coined for addressing personalized manufacturing and empowering humans in manufacturing processes. The onset of the term Industry 5.0 is observed to have various views of how it is defined and what constitutes the reconciliation between humans and machines. This serves as the motivation of this paper in identifying and analyzing the various themes and research trends of what Industry 5.0 is using text mining tools and techniques. Toward this, the abstracts of 196 published papers based on the keyword “Industry 5.0” search in IEEE, science direct and MDPI data bases were extracted. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed for further analysis to apply text mining techniques of key terms extraction and frequency analysis. Further topic mining i.e., unsupervised machine learning method was used for exploring the data. It is observed that the terms artificial intelligence (AI), big data, supply chain, digital transformation, machine learning, internet of things (IoT), are among the most often used and among several enablers that have been identified by researchers to drive Industry 5.0. Five major themes of Industry 5.0 addressing, supply chain evaluation and optimization, enterprise innovation and digitization, smart and sustainable manufacturing, transformation driven by IoT, AI, and Big Data, and Human-machine connectivity were classified among the published literature, highlighting the research themes that can be further explored.

As a mediator, fog computing re-sides between vehicles and the cloud and provides vehicles with processing, storage, and networking power through Vehicular Ad-hoc networks (VANET). VANET is a time-sensitive technology that requires less time to process a request received from a vehicle. Delay and latency are the noto-rious issues of VANET and fog computing. To deal with such problems, in this work, we developed a priority-based fog computing model for smart urban vehicle transportation that reduces the delay and latency of fog computing. To upgrade the fog computing infrastructure to meet the latency and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, 5G localized Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) servers have also been used, which resulted tremendously in reducing the delay and the latency. We de-creased the data latency by 20% compared to the experiment carried using only cloud computing architecture.

Moreover, in new networking paradigms, such as the Internet of Things, traditional methods of security may be difficult to implement due to the radical change of requirements and constraints. In such contexts, physical layer security is a promising additional means to realize communication security with low complexity. In particular, this paper focuses on node authentication and spoofing detection in an actual wireless sensor network (WSN), where multiple nodes communicate with a sink node. Nodes are in fixed positions, but the communication channels varies due to the scatterers’ movement. In the proposed security framework, the sink node is able to perform a continuous authentication of nodes during communication based on wireless fingerprinting. In particular, a machine learning approach is used for authorized nodes classification by means of the identification of specific attributes of their wireless channel. Then classification results are compared with the node ID in order to detect if the message has been generated by a node other than its claimed source. Finally, in order to increase the spoofing detection performance in small networks, the use of low-complexity sentinel nodes is proposed here. Results show the good performance of the proposed method that is suitable for actual implementation in a WSN. © 2022 by the authors.

New solutions integrating Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) with sustainable transport media are encouraged by several public administrations in the so-called Smart City scenario, where heterogeneous users in city roads call for safer mobility. Among several possible applications, recently, there has been a lot of attention on the so-called Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), such as pedestrians or bikers. They can be equipped with wearable sensors that are able to communicate their data through a chain of devices towards the cloud for agile and effective control of their mobility. This work describes a complete end-to-end IoT system implemented through the integration of different complementary technologies, whose main purpose is to monitor the information related to road users generated by wearable sensors. The system has been implemented using an ESP32 micro-controller connected to the sensors and communicating through a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface with an Android device, which is assumed to always be carried by any road user. Based on this, we use it as a gateway node, acting as a real-time asynchronous publisher of a Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol chain. The MQTT broker is configured on a Raspberry PI device and collects sensor data to be sent to a web-based control panel that performs data monitoring and processing. All the architecture modules have been implemented through open-source technologies. The analysis of the BLE packet exchange has been carried out by resorting to the Wireshark packet analyzer. In addition, a feasibility analysis has been carried out by showing the capability of the proposed solution to show the values gathered through the sensors on a remote dashboard. The developed system is publicly available to allow the possible integration of other modules for additional Smart City services or extension to further ICT applications. © 2022 by the authors.

Meanwhile, in the paradigm of edge computing, device integration, data retention characteristics and power consumption are particularly important. In this paper, the self-selected device (SSD), which is the base cell for building the densest three-dimensional (3D) architecture, is used to store non-volatile weights in binary neural networks (BNN) for embedded NN applications. Considering that the prevailing issues in written data retention on the device can affect the energy efficiency of the system’s operation, the data loss mechanism of the self-selected cell is elucidated. On this basis, we introduce an optimized method to retain oxygen ions and prevent their diffusion toward the switching layer by introducing a titanium interfacial layer. By using this optimization, the recombination probability of Vo and oxygen ions is reduced, effectively improving the retention characteristics of the device. The optimization effect is verified using a simulation after mapping the BNN weights to the 3D VRRAM array constructed by the SSD before and after optimization. The simulation results showed that the long-term recognition accuracy (greater than 105 s) of the pre-trained BNN was improved by 24% and that the energy consumption of the system during training can be reduced 25,000-fold while ensuring the same accuracy.

The diversity of IoT devices, and the variety of QoS requirements among several domains of IoT application, impose considerable challenges in designing and implementing a robust IoT security solution. The aim of this paper is to present an efficient, robust, and easy-to-use system, for IoT cyber security operators. Following a by-design security approach, the proposed system is a platform comprising four distinct yet cooperating components; a distributed AI-enhanced detection of potential threats and anomalies mechanisms, an AI-based generation of effective mitigation strategies according to the severity of detected threats, a system for the verification of SDN routing decisions along with networkand resource-related policies, and a comprehensive and intuitive security status visualization and analysis. The distributed anomaly detection scheme implementing multiple AI-powered agents is deployed across the IoT network nodes aiming to efficiently monitor the entire network infrastructure. Network traffic data are fed to the AI agents, which process consecutive traffic samples from the network in a time series analysis manner, where consecutive time windows framing the traffic of the surrounding nodes are processed by a graph neural network algorithm. Any detected anomalies are handled by a mitigation engine employing a distributed neural network algorithm, which exploits the recorded anomalous events and deploys appropriate responses for optimal threat mitigation.

To fully utilize hardware resources, the internal GNSS chips or modules equipped in IoT terminals should satisfy the traits of energy efficiency and low computational complexity. As the number of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) increases, the continuous accumulation of high-dimensional rounding errors, the rough system model, and seriously distorted observations will result in divergence and considerable processing burden in the conventional Kalman filter (KF) process. Computational efficiency is significant in the reduction in the power consumption and intensifies the positioning performance of GNSS receivers. Here, a new filter strategy based on UD factorization, where U stands for the unit upper-triangular factor and D indicates the diagonal factor, is proposed for RTK positioning to enhance the numerical stability and reduce the computational effort. The equivalent principle was applied to turn double-difference (DD) observations into zero-difference (ZD) observations. Then, the UD-factorization-based Kalman filter (UD-KF) is proposed as a way to sequentially provide accurate real-time estimations of the filter states and variance–covariance (VC) matrix. Both static and dynamic tests were carried out with single-frequency data from a GPS to evaluate the performance of UD-KF. The results of the zero-baseline test show that UD-KF can obtain smaller RMS of the estimated parameters as the noise of DD observations was twice that of the ZD observations. A short baseline test showed that, compared to the regular filter approach with DD observations, UD-KF achieved a shorter computation time with a higher data utilization rate for both filtering and fixing stages, with an average improvement of 32% and 18%. Finally, a dynamic test showed that the UD-KF can avoid the undesirable effect of satellite changes. Therefore, compared to KF with DD observations, the UD-KF with equivalent ZD observations can enhance the robustness as well as improve the positioning accuracy of RTK positioning. © 2022 by the authors.

Likewise, when using in-person services, such as going to a concert, after paying for this service, the user usually receives a ticket, which proves that he/she has the right to use that service. In both scenarios, the main concerns surround the centralization of these systems and that they do not ensure customers’ privacy. The involved service providers are trusted third parties—authorities that offer services and handle private data about users. In this paper, we designed and implemented FORT, a decentralized system that allows customers to prove their rights to use specific services (either online or in-person) without revealing sensitive information. To achieve decentralization, we proposed a solution where all of the data are handled by a blockchain. We describe and uniquely identify users’ rights using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and possession of these rights is demonstrated by using zero-knowledge proofs—cryptographic primitives that allow us to guarantee customers’ privacy. Furthermore, we provide benchmarks of FORT, which show that our protocol is efficient enough to be used in devices with low computing resources, such as smartphones or smartwatches, which are devices commonly used in our use case scenario. © 2022 by the authors.

With the explosive growth in the use of IoT devices, it is essential to design effective and efficient channel access schemes for the 802.15.4 networks. In order to improve channel contention efficiency (CCE), which is defined as the number of times of successfully gaining the channel per unit of backoff time whereby throughput is improved, the scheme of enhancing channel contention efficiency (ECCE) has been proposed to jointly optimize the three key parameters of macMinBe, macMaxBe and macMaxCsmaBackoffs in the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA-CA) mechanism in the 802.15.4 standard. A novel Markov chain was developed to model the CSMA-CA mechanism, which yielded the expected number of failures in gaining the channel, the expected number of backoff periods and the expected number of backoffs when a node intended to transmit a packet. These statistics resulted in CCE. An optimization problem that maximized the CCE with respect to the above-mentioned three key parameters was formulated. The solution to the optimization problem led to the optimal parameter values, which were applied in the ECCE scheme.

Although the introduced EH technology can alleviate the energy limitation problem that occurs in the traditional wireless sensor network (WSN), most of the current studies on EH-WSN fail to adequately consider the relationship between energy state and data buffer constraint, and thereby they do not address well the issues of energy efficiency and long end-to-end delay. In view of the above problems, a brand new greedy strategy-based energy-efficient routing protocol is proposed in this paper. Firstly, in the system modeling process, we construct an energy evaluation model, which comprehensively considers the energy harvesting, energy consumption and energy classification factors, to identify the energy state of node. Then, we establish a channel feature-based communication range judgment model to determine the transmission area of nodes. Combining these two models, a reception state adjustment mechanism is designed. It takes the buffer occupancy and the MAC layer protocol into account to adjust the data reception state of nodes. On this basis, we propose a greedy strategy-based routing algorithm. In addition, we also analyze the correctness and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation experiments to show that our algorithm achieves optimum performance in energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, average hop count and end-to-end delay and acceptable performance in energy variance. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, we consider the grant-free uplink transmission of an IoT network with a multiple-antenna base station (BS) and a large number of single-antenna IoT devices. Taking into account the sporadic nature of IoT devices, we formulate the joint activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) problem as a group-sparse matrix estimation problem. This problem can be solved by applying the existing compressed sensing techniques, which however either suffer from high computational complexities or lack of algorithm robustness. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm unrolling framework based on the deep neural network to simultaneously achieve low computational complexity and high robustness for solving the JADCE problem. Specifically, we map the original iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) into an unrolled recurrent neural network (RNN), thereby improving the convergence rate and computational efficiency through end-to-end training. Moreover, the proposed algorithm unrolling approach inherits the structure and domain knowledge of the ISTA, thereby maintaining the algorithm robustness, which can handle non-Gaussian preamble sequence matrix in massive access. With rigorous theoretical analysis, we further simplify the unrolled network structure by reducing the redundant training parameters. Furthermore, we prove that the simplified unrolled deep neural network structures enjoy a linear convergence rate. Extensive simulations based on various preamble signatures show that the proposed unrolled networks outperform the existing methods in terms of the convergence rate, robustness and estimation accuracy. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","algorithm unrolling; deep learning; group-sparse matrix estimation; joint activity detection and channel estimation; Massive access","Antennas; Channel estimation; Computational complexity; Computational efficiency; Domain Knowledge; Internet of things; Iterative methods; Recurrent neural networks; Activity detection; Algorithm unrolling; Deep learning; Group sparse; Group-sparse matrix estimation; Joint activity; Joint activity detection and channel estimation; Massive access; Matrix estimation; Sparse matrices; Deep neural networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124908495

However, the sensor nodes that rely on a very limited power source tend to cause disconnection in multi-hop routes due to power shortages in the WSNs, which eventually results in the inefficiency of the overall IoT network. In addition, the density of the available sensor nodes affects the existence of feasible routes and the level of path multiplicity in the WSNs. Therefore, an efficient routing mechanism is expected to extend the lifetime of the WSNs by adaptively selecting the best routes for the data transfer between interconnected IoT devices. In this work, we propose a novel routing mechanism to balance the energy consumption among all the nodes and elongate the WSN lifetime, which introduces a score value assigned to each node along a path as the combination of evaluation metrics. Specifically, the scoring scheme considers the information of the node density at a certain area and the node energy levels in order to represent the importance of individual nodes in the routes. Furthermore, our routing mechanism allows for incorporating non-cooperative nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed work gives comparatively better results than some other experimented protocols. © 2022 by the authors.

In the framework, a collaborative mining process is designed, where we consider the cooperation between mobile devices (MDs) and MEC servers.

In the Re-PoW consensus mechanism, heterogeneous capabilities and historical behaviors of MDs are all considered for accurately evaluating their reputation.

In recent years, the number of cloud services has multiplied, resulting in cloud services providing similar services with similar functionality but varying in Quality of Services (QoS), for instance, on the response time of web services; however, existing methods are insufficient in solving large-scale repository issues. Bio-inspired algorithm methods have shown better performance in solving the large-scale service composition problems, unlike deterministic algorithms, which are restricted. Thus, an improved eagle strategy algorithm method is proposed to increase the performance that directly indicates an improvement in computation time in large-scale DWSC in a cloud-based platform and on both functional and non-functional attributes of services. By proposing the improved bio-inspired method, the computation time can be improved, especially in a large-scale repository of IoT. © 2022 by the authors.

The transfer of this data to the cloud is a challenging problem because of the congestion at the network level, and therefore processing time could be too long when we use a pure cloud computing strategy. On the other hand, new applications requiring the processing of large amounts of data in real time have gradually emerged, such as virtual reality and augmented reality. These new applications have gradually won over users and developed a demand for near real-time interaction of their applications, which has completely called into question the way we process and store data. To address these two problems of congestion and computing time, edge architecture has emerged with the goal of processing data as close as possible to users, and to ensure privacy protection and responsiveness in real-time. With the continuous increase in computing power, amounts of memory and data storage at the level of smartphone and connected objects, it is now possible to process data as close as possible to sensors or directly on users devices. The coupling of these two types of processing as close as possible to the data and to the user opens up new perspectives in terms of services. In this paper, we present a new distributed edge architecture aiming to process and store Internet of Things and multimedia data close to the data producer, offering fast response time (closer to real time) in order to meet the demands of modern applications. To do this, the processing at the level of the producers of data collaborate with the processing ready for the users, establishing a new paradigm of short supply circuit for data transmission inspired of short supply chains in agriculture. The removing of unnecessary intermediaries between the producer and the consumer of the data improves efficiency. We named this new paradigm the Short Supply Circuit Internet of Things (SSCIoT). © 2022 by the authors.

It is deep in many industries, affecting people's lives in all directions. The rapid development of the IoT technology accelerates the process of the era of 'Internet of everything' but also changes the role of terminal equipment at the edge of the network. It has changed from a single data user to a dual role of both producing and using data. And collaborative edge computing (CEC) has been born in time. CEC itself can not only solve the problem of computing and storage but also combines with the deep learning (DL) model to make full use of edge computing ability. However, as the core of DL, the robustness of neural network is often not high. In addition, edge devices of CEC are facing a highly dynamic environment, which can easily cause the edge network to be attacked by malicious devices. Therefore, user privacy protection and security issues for CEC deserve more attention. To avoid privacy leakage and security crisis of CEC in social IoT systems, a data protection method based on data disturbance method and adversarial training viewpoint is introduced in this article. Besides, a new adversarial sample generation method based on the firefly algorithm (FA) is proposed. This method reduces the time complexity of traditional by an order for magnitude compared with traditional generative adversarial network (GAN) generation. Since sentences, information on CEC in the IoT system is characterized by a large amount of data, strict confidentiality, and high-security requirements, and they are usually high-risk information on privacy leakage. The proposed method is conducted to the sentence similarity analysis model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) in the CEC scene to test the feasibility of the method. Compared with the original CNN, the accuracy of the model using the confrontation training method is improved by 4.8%. At the same time, the security value of our model is 2.1% higher than that of the simple CNN model, and it has the best security performance among the four comparison models. Further experiments have demonstrated that the model performs better in its capacity of resisting disturbance and can effectively help multiple organizations to implement data usage and sentence information on the requirements of user privacy protection, data security, and government regulations. © 2014 IEEE.","Collaborative edge computing (CEC); Internet of things (IoT); security management; sentence similarity analysis","Deep learning; Digital storage; Generative adversarial networks; Internet of things; Laws and legislation; Network security; Neural networks; Optimization; Privacy-preserving techniques; Collaborative edge computing; Convolutional neural network; Data disturbance; Edge computing; Internet of thing; Security management; Sentence similarity; Sentence similarity analyse; Similarity analysis; User privacy; Edge computing",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124662736

Among various intelligent components, smart urban transportation monitoring is an essential part of smoothly operational smart cities. Although there is fast development of Smart Cities and the growth of Internet of Things (IoT), real-time anomalous behavior detection in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is still challenging. Because of multiple advanced features including flexibility, safety, and ease of manipulation, quadcopter drones have been widely adopted in many areas, from service improvement to urban surveillance, and data collection for scientific research. In this paper, a Smart Urban traffic Monitoring (SurMon) scheme is proposed employing drones following an edge computing paradigm. A dynamic video stream processing scheme is proposed to meet the require-ments of real-time information processing and decision-making at the edge. Specifically, we propose to identify anomalous vehicle behaviors in real time by creatively applying the multidimensional Singular Spectrum Analysis (mSSA) technique in space to detect the different vehicle behaviors on roads. Multiple features of vehicle behaviors are fed into channels of the mSSA procedure. Instead of trying to create and define a database of normal activity patterns of vehicles on the road, the anomaly detection is reformatted as an outlier identifying problem. Then, a cascaded Capsules Network is designed to predict whether the behavior is a violation.

In addition to enabling individuals to retain ownership of their data and to monetize it, the architecture is also suitable for distributed privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms, is lightweight, and can be implemented in simple internet-of-things (IoT) devices. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply this framework to reinforcement learning settings where a third party is interested in acquiring information from agents.

These tokens, whose authenticated position determines write access to the ledger, are thus used to emulate the probing actions of commanded (real) vehicles on a given planned route by 'jumping' from a passing-by vehicle to another to complete the planned trajectory.

In particular, compact size is essential for emerging application areas such as Internet of Things (IoT), wearable and implantable devices, 5G technology, or medical imaging. On the other hand, reduction of physical dimensions generally has a detrimental effect on antenna performance. From the perspective of numerical optimization, miniaturization is a heavily constrained problem, with most constraints being expensive to evaluate due to involving full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation. A convenient way of handling such a task is a penalty function approach where constraint violations contribute, upon suitable scaling, to the primary objective, i.e., the antenna size. The penalty coefficients determining the aforementioned contributions are normally adjusted through engineering experience, which does not allow for a reliable control of antenna performance figures. This article proposes an efficient management scheme for adaptive adjustment of penalty coefficients, which eliminates the need for objective function setup by trial and error, and ensures precise control of the design constraints. Our approach is demonstrated using three broadband antennas optimized for minimum size with acceptance thresholds imposed on the in-band matching level. The adaptive adjustment of penalty coefficients is shown to outperform experience-driven setups in terms of constraint control precision and the final design quality. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Antenna design; Compact antennas; Constraint handling; Electromagnetic (EM)-driven optimization; Penalty functions; Size reduction","5G mobile communication systems; Constraint handling; Implants (surgical); Internet of things; Medical imaging; Miniature instruments; Quality control; Size determination; Antenna design; Compact antenna; Constraint handling; Electromagnetic -driven optimization; Electromagnetics; Miniaturisation; Optimisations; Penalty coefficient; Penalty function; Size-reduction; Constrained optimization",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124620566

A first step in this direction would be to be able to accurately estimate the harvestable energy in a specific light environment. However, inside, this energy varies in spectral composition and intensity, depending on the emission source as well as the time of day. These challenging conditions mean that it has become necessary to obtain accurate information about these variations and determine their impact on energy recovery performance. In this context, this manuscript presented a method to apply an innovative energy harvesting estimation method to obtain practical and accurate insight for the design of energy harvesting systems in indoor environments. It used a very low-cost device to obtain spectral information and fed it to supervised machine learning classification methods to recognize light sources. From the recognized light source, a model developed for flexible GaAs solar cells was able to estimate the harvestable energy. To validate this method in real indoor conditions, the estimates were compared to the energy harvested by an energy harvesting prototype. The mean absolute error percentage between estimates and the experimental measurements was less than 5% after more than 2 weeks of observation. This demonstrated the potential of this low-cost estimation system to obtain reliable information to design energetically autonomous devices. © 2022 by the authors.

Nata de Coco's manufacturing process usually mixes coconut water solution with vinegar and seed solution. The mixing process is usually used with manual measurement. In the mixing process, the makers usually only measure the amount of the solution mixture regardless of the final result and the effect of temperature and acidity levels for the ingredients. This can lead to the failure of the mixing process for the Nata de Coco solution. Therefore, in order for the mixing process to be controlled and to improve the quality and success rate of the mixture, it takes a system that can monitor the mixing process and the result of mixing the manufacture of Nata de Coco. The method used in the creation of this monitoring system refers to the prototype method with the stages of communication, quick planning, model design, prototype building, and system usage. The result of this study is a system that can perform the process of mixing Nata de Coco material solution that can be monitored in realtime in order to produce an excellent product with a good acidity level that is with a value of 3.5 to 7.5.

First, we set up a cloud-fog computing architecture for intelligent production lines and built the multi-objective function for task scheduling, which minimizes the service delay and energy consumption of the tasks. In addition, the improved hybrid monarch butterfly optimization and improved ant colony optimization algorithm (HMA) are used to search for the optimal task scheduling scheme. Finally, HMA is evaluated by rigorous simulation experiments, showing that HMA outperformed other algorithms in terms of task completion rate. When the number of nodes exceeds 10, the completion rate of all tasks is greater than 90%, which well meets the real-time requirements of the corresponding tasks in the intelligent production lines.

The purpose of this study is to improve the security of data collected through remote health monitoring of patients utilizing Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Asymmetric cryptography techniques may be used to assure the security of such sensor networks. For communication between different IoMT devices and a remote server, the safe CoAP is compatible with the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol for creating a secure session using existing algorithms such as Lightweight Establishment of Secure Session. The DTLS layer of CoAP, in contrast, has shortcomings in key control, session establishment, and multicast message exchange. As a consequence, for IoMT communication, the creation of an efficient protocol for safe CoAP session establishment is needed. Thus, to solve the existing problems related to key management and multicast security in CoAP, we have proposed an efficient and secure communication technique to establish a secure session key between IoMT devices and distant servers using lightweight Energy-Efficient and Secure CoAP Elliptic Curve Cryptography (E2SCEC2). The advantage of using E2SCEC2 over other identification methods such as Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) is its compact key size, which allows it to use a smaller key size. This article also compares these algorithms on parameters such as time spent generating keys, signature generation, and verification of E2SCEC2 and RSA algorithms, as well as energy consumption and radio duty cycle, to see if they are compatible in constrained environments.

The paper also presents aGIDDI’s architecture and proof-of-concept implementation, as well as an experimental evaluation of the performance and scalability of aGIDDI in variety of IoT device integration and payment scenarios. © 2022 by the authors.

IoT offers several innovation capabilities and features, but they are also prone to security vulnerabilities and risks. These vulnerabilities must be studied to protect these technologies from being exploited by others. Cryptography techniques and approaches are commonly used to address and deal with security vulnerabilities. In general, the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) is an application layer protocol vulnerable to various known and unknown security issues. One possible solution is to introduce an encryption algorithm into the MQTT communication protocol for secure transmission. This study aims to solve the security problem of IoT traffic by using a secure and lightweight communication proxy. The strategy behind this communication broker acts as a network gateway providing secure transaction keys to all IoT nodes in the network. This task uses a java servlet and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) algorithm to generate identity encryption keys in a component-based web transaction infrastructure. This approach encrypts the data before it is sent via the MQTT protocol to secure the communication channel and raise the security device and network transactions. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Because of the complexity of those components, it is necessary to define reference architectures models to manage Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet of Things. The reference architecture models aim to solve the interoperability problem enabling the syntactical and semantic levels of interoperability. A reference architecture model provides a bottom/top view of an industrial process, from the physical transducers at the physical layer to the business layer. The physical layer provides access to a twin representation of a physical thing in the digital world, extending the functionalities in the manufacturing process. This paper studies the syntactic interoperability between the IEEE 1451 and IEC 61499 in an industrial environment. The IEEE 1451 family of standards has the essential characteristics to support the information exchange between smart transducers (sensors and actuators), building the digital elements and meeting the Industry 4.0 requirements. The IEC 61499 standard enables industrial control and automation. These two standards combined at the syntactic level solve an interoperability problem. The IEC 61499 also provides data to the framework layer, supplying all the parameters defined for the communication layer specified by a reference architecture model. This paper combines the IEEE 1451 with the IEC 61499, enabling data exchange in a reference architecture model proposed for Industry 4.0. Network performance at the communication level of a reference architecture model in a local network and an external network is evaluated for the proposed application. The IEEE 1451 standard implementation and adoption to acquire data and communicate it inside an industrial process allowed the IEC 61499 standard to control an industrial process. The IEEE 1451 standard is implemented in a MSP430 low power microcontroller. A Raspberry Pi running FORTE and 4diac in the USA and Portugal were used to test a local network in Portugal and an external network in USA. Data related to network performance was obtained with Wireshark and processed with MATLAB. Tests using the Message Queuing Transport Telemetry Transport and Hypertext Transport Protocols verified the performance of these protocols, supported by the IEEE 1451 and IEC 61499 standards, showing that communication inside an Industry 4.0 environment is possible. MQTT protocol is faster, has a small packet size, and consumes less bandwidth. The HTTP protocol uses more bandwidth but is more reliable for real-time communication, essential for Industry 4.0. © 2022 by the authors.

Efficient authentication and secure data transmission are the influential impediments of these networks that need to be addressed to maintain credence among clients, healthcare specialists, pharmacologists, and other associated entities. To address the authentication and data privacy issues in smart healthcare, in this paper we propose a lightweight hybrid deep learning protocol to achieve security and privacy. To achieve better results, we enabled the decentralized authentication of legitimate patient wearable devices to minimize computation cost, authentication time, and communication overheads with the help of an ML technique to predicate and forward the authentication attributes of patient wearable devices to the next concerned trusted authority, when it is shifted from region to another region. Simulation up-shots of the ML scheme exhibited extraordinary security features with the cost‐effective validation of legal patient wearable devices accompanied by worthwhile communication function-alities compared with previous work.

The adoption of such systems is revolutionized by a propelling advancements in IoT and Blockchain technologies. Owing to technological advancement in IoT sensors market, innovations in HCS to monitor patients health status have motivated many countries to strength their efforts to support their citizens with such care delivery systems under the directives of a physician who has access to patient’s data. Nevertheless, secure data sharing is a principal patient’s concern to be comfort to use such systems. Current HCS are not able to provide reassuring security policies. For that, one of our focus in this work, is to provide security countermeasures, likewise cost-efficient solution for HCS by integrating storage model based on Blockchain and Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS). Blockchain technology is an emerging solution in pharmaceutical industry and starts to take place for HCS and allows HealthCare providers to track connected devices and control access to shared data, hence protecting patients’ privacy. Furthermore, the addition of Edge and Fog computing has improved HCS to react in real-time and enhance their reliability. A variety of communication protocols can connect sensor devices to edge/Fog layer and the best choice will depend upon connectivity requirements: range, bandwidth, power, interoperability, security, and reliability. Instead, systems efficiency would decline and hurt if communication protocol is inconsistent. LoRa (Long Range) communications technology is emerging as the leader among Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) entering the IoT domain benefiting from many features such as long-range distances and low power consumption. This work proposes LoRaChainCare, an architecture model for HCS which combines the technologies Blockchain, Fog/Edge computing, and the LoRa communication protocol.

To mitigate the hostile underwater channel characteristics, this article considers a multimodal underwater network that hybridizes acoustic and optical wireless communications to achieve an ubiquitous control and high-speed low-latency networking performance, respectively. Since underwater optical wireless communications (UOWCs) suffer from limited range, it requires effective multihop routing solutions. In this regard, we propose a sector-based opportunistic routing (SectOR) protocol. Unlike the traditional unicast routing (TUR) techniques, which send packets to a unique relay, opportunistic routing (OR) targets a set of candidate relays by leveraging the broadcast nature of the UOWC channel. OR improves the packet delivery ratio as the likelihood of having at least one successful packet reception is much higher than that in TUR. Contingent upon the performance characterization of a single-hop link, we obtain a variety of local and global metrics to evaluate the fitness of a candidate set (CS) and develop candidate prioritization techniques for various OR metrics. Since rate - error and range - beamwidth tradeoffs yield different CS diversities, we develop a candidate filtering and searching algorithm to find the optimal sector shaped coverage region by scanning the feasible search space. Moreover, a hybrid acoustic/optic coordination mechanism is considered to avoid duplicate transmission of the relays. Numerical results show that the SectOR protocol can perform even better than optimal unicast routing protocols in well-connected underwater networks. © 2021 IEEE.","Acoustics; Internet of Things; Measurement; Optical sensors; Routing; Routing protocols; Unicast","Internet of things; Internet protocols; Military applications; Power management (telecommunication); Candidate sets; Internet of underwater things; Opportunistic routing; Opto-acoustic; Routing-protocol; Routings; Technological revolution; Underwater networks; Unicast; Unicast routing; Routing protocols",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124424241

To improve the energy management, we are proposing an efficient forwarding scheme in energy-constrained wireless ICNs. To achieve this goal, we consider the type of devices, their internal energy and the network context, among other parameters. The proposed forwarding strategy extends and adapts concepts of ICNs, by means of packet domain analysis, neighbourhood evaluation and node sleeping and waking strategies. The proposed solution takes advantage of the neighbourhood to be aware of the moments to listen and forward packets in order to consistently address mobility, improving the quality of content delivery. The evaluation is performed by simulation with real datasets of urban mobility, one from the lagoon of “Ria de Aveiro” and the other from a vehicular network in the city of Porto. The results show that the proposed forwarding scheme resulted in significant improvements in network content availability, in the overall energy saving and, consequently, in the network lifetime. © 2022 by the authors.

IoT applications often require the presence of many technologies such as cloud computing and fog computing, which have led to serious challenges to security. As a result of the use of these technologies, cyberattacks are also on the rise because current security methods are ineffective. Several artificial intelligence (AI)-based security solutions have been presented in recent years, including intrusion detection systems (IDS). Feature selection (FS) approaches are required for the development of intelligent analytic tools that need data pretreatment and machinelearning algorithm-performance enhancement. By reducing the number of selected features, FS aims to improve classification accuracy. This article presents a new FS method through boosting the performance of Gorilla Troops Optimizer (GTO) based on the algorithm for bird swarms (BSA). This BSA is used to boost performance exploitation of GTO in the newly developed GTO-BSA because it has a strong ability to find feasible regions with optimal solutions. As a result, the quality of the final output will increase, improving convergence. GTO-BSA’s performance was evaluated using a variety of performance measures on four IoT-IDS datasets: NSL-KDD, CICIDS-2017, UNSW-NB15 and BoT-IoT. The results were compared to those of the original GTO, BSA, and several state-of-the-art techniques in the literature.

To reduce smart vehicle accidents and detect malicious attacks in vehicular networks, several researchers have presented machine learning (ML)-based models for intrusion detection in IoT networks. However, a proficient and real-time faster algorithm is needed to detect malicious attacks in IoV. This article proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for cyber attack detection in IoV. The proposed model is based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The performance of the proposed model is analyzed by using two datasets—a combined DDoS dataset that contains CIC DoS, CI-CIDS 2017, and CSE-CIC-IDS 2018, and a car-hacking dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher attack detection accuracy of 99.5% and 99.9% for DDoS and car hacks, respectively.

To protect data privacy and device availability, identity authentication technology has been applied to the IoT environment. However, although scholars have designed a variety of authentication protocols for the IoT environment, the resource costs of these protocols are still expensive for resource-constrained devices. In particular, when the frequent upgrade of computer hardware has led to a gradual increase in the key length of the cryptosystem, IoT devices are hard to keep up with the upgrade speed because of the balance between cost and tasks. Although the storage space has increased in recent years, the computational and communication capabilities are still limited by some physical factors, such as energy, power, and communication link bandwidth. To improve the situation, this article proposes an anonymous authentication protocol suitable for IoT devices with current hardware performance, which is based on elliptic curve and signcryption techniques. Compared to other protocols, our protocol further reduces the communication and computing cost of the client devices while ensuring security requirements. Thus, we formally prove its theoretical security under the random oracle model and use simulation experiments to verify that the protocol can effectively reduce the resource requirements. © 2021 IEEE.","Authentication; Elliptic curve cryptography; Internet of Things; Privacy; Protocols; Security; Smart meters","Authentication; Data privacy; Digital storage; Geometry; Internet protocols; Public key cryptography; Anonymous authentication; Authentication protocols; Authentication technology; Identity authentication; Key lengths; Privacy; Resource costs; Resourceconstrained devices; Security; Storage spaces; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124325068

We have demonstrated a wireless IoT sensor that could be attached and carried by mice (i.e., animals that typically weigh only 20 g and with body length of ~10 cm) and used the collected motion data to recognize five common mice behaviors (e.g., sleeping, walking, rearing, digging, and shaking) in cages with an accuracy of ~76%. For comparison, current commercial video-based tracking systems that track animal behaviors in real time can reach only 70% accuracy and with limited number of parallelly tracked animals. Furthermore, several machine learning algorithms were explored to solve the imbalanced sample data problem, which allowed the accuracy of mice motion recognition to improve from ~48% to ~76% (if shaking is removed from classification, an average accuracy of 86.46% could be achieved). Less frequent mice behaviors, such as rearing, digging, grooming, drinking, and scratching, could also be recognized at an average accuracy of 96.35%.

However, the backhaul link and an access link between the FlyBS and users should be managed together to exploit radio resources efficiently. Thus, we introduce a novel framework considering the FlyBSs with a realistic backhaul to maximize the sum capacity of the users. First, we propose a scheme for an association of the users and a transmission power allocation. Thus, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal allocation of the FlyBSs' transmission power to individual users to utilize the radio resources at the backhaul and access links in an efficient way. Second, we develop an algorithm for a repositioning of the FlyBSs and a reallocation of the FlyBSs' transmission power to further improve the overall sum capacity. Third, we design a scheme reusing the access links by multiple users in the coalitions to reduce the FlyBSs' transmission power. The reduced transmission power allows to further increase the sum capacity of the users via an additional repositioning of the FlyBSs. Alternatively, the reduced transmission power also lowers the level of interference experienced by the underlying devices not communicating via the FlyBSs. Our proposal increases the sum capacity of the users by up to 60 while suppressing the interference to the underlying devices by up to 7.7 dB compared to the state-of-the-art schemes. 2327-4662 © 2021 IEEE.

To overcome this limitation in SHC, we propose a federated learning-based person movement identification (FL-PMI).

It is an evolution of the existing vehicular ad hoc network architecture due to the increasingly heterogeneous nature of the various existing networks in road traffic environments that need to be integrated. The existing literature on vehicular communication is lacking in the area of network optimization for heterogeneous network environments. In this context, this paper proposes a heterogeneous network model for IoV and service-oriented network optimization. The network model focuses on three key networking entities: vehicular cloud, heterogeneous communication, and smart use cases as clients. Most traffic-related data–oriented computations are performed at cloud servers for making intelligent decisions. The connection component enables handoff-centric network communication in heterogeneous vehicular environments. The use-case-oriented smart traffic services are implemented as clients for the network model. The model is tested for various service-oriented metrics in heterogeneous vehicular communication environments with the aim of affirming several service benefits. Future challenges and issues in heterogeneous IoV environments are also highlighted. © 2022 by the authors.

However, security concerns regarding the source, confidentiality and integrity of the data arise. The most common method of protecting data transmission in sensor systems is Transport Layer Security (TLS) or its datagram counterpart (DTLS) today, but exist an alternative option based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that promise strong security, ease of use and potential for large scale integration of heterogeneous sensor systems. A DLT such as the IOTA Tangle offers great potential to improve sensor data exchange. This paper presents L2Sec, a cryptographic protocol which is able to secure data exchanged over the IOTA Tangle. This protocol is suitable for implementation on constrained devices, such as common IoT devices, leading to greater scalability. The first experimental results evidence the effectiveness of the approach and advocate for the integration of an hardware secure element to improve the overall security of the protocol.

The sensing nodes of the wireless sensor network should be enabled to provide better services with limited energy to support wide-range and multi-scenario acquisition and transmission of three-dimensional crop information. Further, the life cycle of the sensing nodes should be maximized under limited energy. The transmission direction and node power consumption are considered, and the forward and high-energy nodes are selected as the preferred cluster heads or data-forwarding nodes. Taking the cropland cultivation of ginseng as the background, we put forward a particle swarm optimization-based networking algorithm for wireless sensor networks with excellent performance. This algorithm can be used for precision agriculture and achieve optimal equipment configuration in a network under limited energy, while ensuring reliable communication in the network. The node scale is configured as 50 to 300 nodes in the range of 500 × 500 m2, and simulated testing is conducted with the LEACH, BCDCP, and ECHERP routing protocols. Compared with the existing LEACH, BCDCP, and ECHERP routing protocols, the proposed networking method can achieve the network lifetime prolongation and mitigate the decreased degree and decreasing trend of the distance between the sensing nodes and center nodes of the sensor network, which results in a longer network life cycle and stronger environment suitability.

Even though these voice transactions are frictionless for end users, they are susceptible to typical attacks to authentication protocols (e.g., replay). Using traditional knowledge-based or possession-based authentication with additional invasive interactions raises users concerns regarding security and usefulness. State-of-the-art schemes for trusted devices with physical unclonable functions (PUF) have complex enrollment processes. We propose a scheme based on a challenge response protocol with a trusted Internet of Things (IoT) autonomous device for hands-free scenarios (i.e., with no additional user interaction), integrated with smart home behavior for continuous authentication. The protocol was validated with automatic formal security analysis. A proof of concept with websockets presented an average response time of 383 ms for mutual authentication using a 6-message protocol with a simple enrollment process. We performed hands-free activity recognition of a specific user, based on smart home testbed data from a 2-month period, obtaining an accuracy of 97% and a recall of 81%. Given the data minimization privacy principle, we could reduce the total number of smart home events time series from 7 to 5.

However, the inclusion of massive devices, which form the core of IoT, raises plenty of security concerns. Many security strategies to handle data privacy have been proposed in previous work. However, very few of these schemes addressed the confidentiality of the sensor node's position. The goal of this study is to ensure source node location privacy by source location privacy preservation technique by randomized ring routing and confounding transmission (SLP-RRRCT). Random routing with confusing transmission benefits the SLP-RRRCT by distracting the adversary backtracking process. After the random routing phase expires, packets are forwarded to the base station (BS) by neighbour grid-based ring routing. During the development of SLP-RRRCT, we concentrated on the privacy of sensor node position, sensor energy usage, network lifetime, and packet routing randomization. Through a simulation experiment and theoretical analysis, we have observed that the proposed SLP-RRRCT provides better safety time, randomization in transmission delay, and large network lifetime than the compared techniques, i.e., baseline, probabilistic, phantom, source location protection protocol based on dynamic routing (SLPDR), and source location privacy protection scheme based on ring-loop routing (SLPRR). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Confounding routing; Internet of Things; Privacy; Random routing; Ring-based routing; Source location privacy; Wireless sensor network","Data privacy; Location; Network routing; Random processes; Sensor nodes; Confounding routing; Nodes' positions; Preservation techniques; Privacy; Privacy preservation; Random routing; Ring-based routing; Routings; Source-location privacy; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124094952

One of the most vulnerable aspects of smart homes is access control. Recent advances in IoT have led to several access control models being developed or adapted to IoT from other domains, with few specifically designed to meet the challenges of smart homes. Most of these models use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) models. As of now, it is not clear what the advantages and disadvantages of ABAC over RBAC are in general, and in the context of smart-home IoT in particular. In this paper, we introduce HABACα, an attribute-based access control model for smart-home IoT. We formally define HABACα and demonstrate its features through two use-case scenarios and a proof-of-concept implementation. Furthermore, we present an analysis of HABACα as compared to the previously published EGRBAC (extended generalized role-based access control) model for smart-home IoT by first describing approaches for constructing HABACα specification from EGRBAC and vice versa in order to compare the theoretical expressiveness power of these models, and second, analyzing HABACα and EGRBAC models against standard criteria for access control models. Our findings suggest that a hybrid model that combines both HABACα and EGRBAC capabilities may be the most suitable for smart-home IoT, and probably more generally. © 2022 by the authors.

Studies have started to investigate their role in the digitalization of asset delivery, including the management of built assets at different levels within the building and infrastructure sectors. However, questions persist regarding their actual applications and implementation chal-lenges, including their integration with other digital technologies (i.e., building information modeling, virtual and augmented reality, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing).

Due to the limited computational capacity available on IoT devices, the current de facto model for building IoT applications is to send the gathered data to the cloud for computation. While building private cloud infrastructures for handling large amounts of data streams can be expensive, using low-cost public (untrusted) cloud infrastructures for processing continuous queries including sensitive data leads to strong concerns over data confidentiality.This article presents C3PO, a confidentiality-preserving, continuous query processing engine, that leverages the public cloud. The key idea is to intelligently utilize partially homomorphic and property-preserving encryption to perform as many computationally intensive operations as possible-without revealing plaintext-in the untrusted cloud. C3PO provides simple abstractions to the developer to hide the complexities of applying complex cryptographic primitives, reasoning about the performance of such primitives, deciding which computations can be executed in an untrusted tier, and optimizing cloud resource usage. An empirical evaluation with several benchmarks and case studies shows the feasibility of our approach. We consider different classes of IoT devices that differ in their computational and memory resources (from a Raspberry Pi 3 to a very small device with a Cortex-M3 microprocessor) and through the use of optimizations, we demonstrate the feasibility of using partially homomorphic and property-preserving encryption on IoT devices. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","cloud computing; confidentiality; IoT; stream processing","Costs; Cryptography; Query processing; Search engines; Cloud infrastructures; Cloud-based; Cloud-computing; Confidentiality; Continuous query processing; Health factors; Personal health; Property-preserving; Sensitive datas; Stream processing; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124016630

We studied several design options based on edge computing and containers for a smart building monitoring system that sends alerts to the responsible personnel when necessary. The study evaluated performance, including a qualitative analysis and load testing, for our experimental settings. From 700+ edge nodes, we obtained response times that were 30% lower for the public cloud versus the local solution. For up to 100 edge nodes, the values were better for the latter, and in between, they were rather similar. Based on an interpretation of the results, we developed recommendations for five real-world configurations, and we present the design choices adopted in our development for a complex of smart buildings. © 2022 by the authors.

With the increase in industrial equipment (e.g., smart mobile terminals, sensors, and other embedded devices) in the Internet of Things and the advent of Industry 4.0, there has been an explosion of data generated that is characterized by a high volume but small size. How to manage and protect sensitive private data in data sharing has become an urgent issue for enterprises. Traditional data sharing and storage relies on trusted third-party platforms or distributed cloud storage, but these approaches run the risk of single-node failure, and third parties and cloud storage providers can be vulnerable to attacks that can lead to data theft. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain-based secure data transfer scheme for enterprises in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT). We store raw data in the IIoT in the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) network after encryption and store the Keyword-index table we designed in Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, and enterprises share the data by querying the Keyword-index table. We use Fabric’s channel mechanism combined with our designed Chaincode to achieve privacy protection and efficient data transmission while using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to ensure data integrity. Finally, we performed security analysis and experiments on the proposed scheme, and the results show that overall the data transfer performance in the IPFS network is generally better than the traditional network, In the case of transferring 5 MB file size data, the transmission speed and latency of IPFS are 19.23 mb/s and 0.26 s, respectively, and the IPFS network is almost 4 times faster than the TCP/IP network while taking only a quarter of the time, which is more advantageous when transferring small files, such as data in the IIOT. In addition, our scheme outperforms the blockchain systems mainly used today in terms of both throughput, latency, and system overhead. The average throughput of our solution can reach 110 tps (transactions are executed per second), and the minimum throughput in experimental tests can reach 101 tps. © 2022 by the authors.","Chaincode; Data security sharing; Hyperledger Fabric blockchain; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); IPFS; Privacy-preserved","Cryptography; Data privacy; Data transfer; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Electronic document identification systems; Internet of things; Block-chain; Chain codes; Data security sharing; Data Sharing; Filesystem; Hyperledg fabric blockchain; Industrial internet of thing; Inter-planetary file system; Privacy-preserved; Systems networks; Blockchain; article; blockchain; cloud computing; data integrity; encryption; experimental test; information security; internet of things; privacy; theft; velocity",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123872454

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are representative examples applied widely in IDS. However, DNN models are becoming increasingly complex in model architectures with high resource computing in hardware requirements. In addition, it is difficult for humans to obtain explanations behind the decisions made by these DNN models using large IoT-based IDS datasets. Many proposed IDS methods have not been applied in practical deployments, because of the lack of explanation given to cybersecurity experts, to support them in terms of optimizing their decisions according to the judgments of the IDS models. This paper aims to enhance the attack detection performance of IDS with big IoT-based IDS datasets as well as provide explanations of machine learning (ML) model predictions. The proposed ML-based IDS method is based on the ensemble trees approach, including decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF) classifiers which do not require high computing resources for training models. In addition, two big datasets are used for the experimental evaluation of the proposed method, NF-BoT-IoT-v2, and NF-ToN-IoT-v2 (new versions of the original BoT-IoT and ToN-IoT datasets), through the feature set of the net flow meter. In addition, the IoTDS20 dataset is used for experiments. Furthermore, the SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) is applied to the eXplainable AI (XAI) methodology to explain and interpret the classification decisions of DT and RF models; this is not only effective in interpreting the final decision of the ensemble tree approach but also supports cybersecurity experts in quickly optimizing and evaluating the correctness of their judgments based on the explanations of the results. © 2022 by the authors.

The importance of water quality is increasing with the ascending water pollution owing to industrialization and depletion of fresh water sources. The countries having low control on reducing water pollution are likely to retain poor public health. Additionally, the methods being used in most developing countries are not effective and are based more on human intervention than on technological and automated solutions. Typically, most of the water samples and related data are monitored and tested in laboratories, which eventually consumes time and effort at the expense of producing fewer reliable results. In view of the above, there is an imperative need to devise a proper and systematic system to regularly monitor and manage the quality of water resources to arrest the related issues. Towards such ends, Internet of Things (IoT) is a great alternative to such traditional approaches which are complex and ineffective and it allows taking remote measurements in real-time with minimal human involvement. The proposed system consists of various water quality measuring nodes encompassing various sensors including dissolved oxygen, turbidity, pH level, water temperature, and total dissolved solids. These sensors nodes deployed at various sites of the study area transmit data to the server for processing and analysis using GSM modules. The data collected over months is used for water quality classification using water quality indices and for bacterial prediction by employing machine learning algorithms. For data visualization, a Web portal is developed which consists of a dashboard of Web services to display the heat maps and other related info-graphics. The real-time water quality data is collected using IoT nodes and the historic data is acquired from the Rawal Lake Filtration Plant. Several machine learning algorithms including neural networks (NN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), ridge regression (RR), support vector machines (SVM), decision tree regression (DTR), Bayesian regression (BR), and an ensemble of all models are trained for fecal coliform bacterial prediction, where SVM and Bayesian regression models have shown the optimal performance with mean squared error (MSE) of 0.35575 and 0.39566 respectively. The proposed system provides an alternative and more convenient solution for bacterial prediction, which otherwise is done manually in labs and is an expensive and time-consuming approach. In addition to this, it offers several other advantages including remote monitoring, ease of scalability, real-time status of water quality, and a portable hardware. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Data analytic; Fecal coliform; Neural networks; Real-time data collection; Water quality index","Biochemical oxygen demand; Decision trees; Developing countries; Dissolved oxygen; Filtration; Forecasting; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Logistic regression; Mean square error; Portals; Radial basis function networks; Support vector regression; Water pollution; Web services; Data analytics; Fecal Coliform; Fresh Water; Industrialisation; Machine learning algorithms; Neural-networks; Primary resources; Real time data collections; Real- time; Water quality indexes; Water quality; dissolved oxygen; Article; controlled study; convolutional neural network; data visualization; decision tree; internet of things; learning algorithm; liquid crystal; machine learning; mean squared error; nonhuman; remote sensing; ridge regression; support vector machine; turbidity; water quality; water supply; water temperature; Bayes theorem; environmental monitoring; human; machine learning; Bayes Theorem; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Internet of Things; Machine Learning; Water Quality",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123815434

To achieve this implementation in a secure way for each actor in the network, we proposed to deploy it over efficient and generic low-performance devices. Thus, they are installed as IoT devices, registering measurements each fifteen minutes, and also acting as blockchain nodes for the marketplace. Nevertheless, it is necessary that blockchain is lightweight, so it is implemented as a specific consensus protocol that allows each node to have enough time and computer requirements to act both as an IoT device and a blockchain node. This marketplace will be ruled by Smart Contracts deployed inside the blockchain. With them, it is possible to make registers for power generation and demand. This low-level marketplace could be connected to other services to execute matching algorithms from the data stored in the blockchain. Finally, a real test-bed implementation of the marketplace was tested, to confirm that it is technically feasible. © 2022 by the authors.

Among these issues, the most important is the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). To maintain the safety of vehicle drivers and road conditions, the IoV can transmit through sensors or infrastructure to maintain communication quality and transmission. However, because 5G uses millimeter waves for transmission, a large number of base stations (BS) or lightweight infrastructure will be built in 5G, which will make the overall environment more complex than 4G. The lightweight infrastructure also has to be considered together. For these reasons, in 5G, there are two mechanisms for handover, horizontal, and vertical handover; hence, it must be discussed how to handle handover to obtain the best performance for the whole network. In this paper, to address handover selection, we consider delay time, energy efficiency, load balancing, and energy consumption and formulate it as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. At the same time, we propose the handover of the mobile management mechanism based on location prediction combined with heuristic algorithms. The results show that our proposed mechanism is better than the distance-based one for energy efficiency, load, and latency. It optimizes by more than about 20% at most. © 2022 by the authors.

Unfortunately, it is faced with numerous security and privacy risks, raising severe concerns among users. Therefore, this research proposes a contextual risk-based access control model for Fog-IoT technology that considers real-time data information requests for IoT devices and gives dynamic feedback. The proposed model uses Fog-IoT environment features to estimate the security risk associated with each access request using device context, resource sensitivity, action severity, and risk history as inputs for the fuzzy risk model to compute the risk factor. Then, the proposed model uses a security agent in a fog node to provide adaptive features in which the device’s behaviour is monitored to detect any abnormal actions from authorised devices. The proposed model is then evaluated against the existing model to benchmark the results.

This work considers the integration of sensing and communications functionalities in a unique platform. To achieve this goal, the use of orthogonal space frequency block codes (SFBC) is proposed. SFBC code orthogonality enables both the separation of communications data streams at a user terminal and the estimation of target parameters. The SFBC enhances the communications link diversity without requiring channel state information knowledge at the transmitter and enable the virtual antenna array concept for enhancing the direction-finding resolution. The use of different SFBCs provides a tradeoff between achieved diversity and sensing resolution. For example, an Alamouti code, applicable for the case with two transmitting antennas, duplicates sensing resolution and achieves a diversity order of two while the use of a Tarokh code, applicable for a scenario with four transmitting antennas, provides a fourfold better resolution and diversity order of four. However, the code rate achieved with the Tarokh code is half of the one achieved with the Alamouti code. Furthermore, the unambiguous range is reduced since the bandwidth is divided to multiplex the different antenna signals. For its simplicity, good performance and reduced integration requirements, the method is promising for future ISAC systems. © 2022 by the authors.

A security analysis system (SAS) is a protective shield against any attack that breaks down data privacy and security. Its main task focuses on detecting malware and verifying app behavior. There are many SASs implemented in various IoT applications. Most of them build on utilizing static or dynamic analysis separately. However, the hybrid analysis is the best for obtaining accurate results. The SAS provides an effective outcome according to many criteria related to the analysis process, such as analysis type, characteristics, sensitivity, and analysis techniques. This paper proposes a new hybrid (static and dynamic) SAS based on the model-checking technique and deep learning, called an HSAS-MD analyzer, which focuses on the holistic analysis perspective of IoT apps. It aims to analyze the data of IoT apps by (1) converting the source code of the target applications to the format of a model checker that can deal with it; (2) detecting any abnormal behavior in the IoT application; (3) extracting the main static features from it to be tested and classified using a deep-learning CNN algorithm; (4) verifying app behavior by using the model-checking technique. HSAS-MD gives the best results in detecting malware from malicious smart Things applications compared to other SASs. The experimental results of HSAS-MD show that it provides 95%, 94%, 91%, and 93% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure, respectively.

Thus, this work presents a strategy for implementing monitoring, control, and communication resources to achieve smart building convergence in legacy building systems. This strategy consists of the use of retrofit techniques based on the adaptation of the SmartLVGrid metamodel. To validate this proposal, we developed hardware platforms and, respectively, their firmware to implement the premises established in a legacy building lighting circuit. The results obtained present a new possibility of implementing smart buildings from the retrofit of legacy infrastructures, as the pre-existing building lighting circuit obtained new functionalities and was preserved as much as possible. © 2022 by the authors.

Its impact is particularly evident in cities and urban areas where governments are trying to mitigate its effects. Although different solutions have been already proposed, citizens continue to report bad conditions in the areas in which they live. This paper proposes a solution to support governments in monitoring the city pollution through the combination of user feedbacks/reports and real-time data acquired through dedicated mobile IoT sensors dynamically re-located by government officials to verify the reported conditions of specific areas. The mobile devices leverage on dedicated sensors to monitor the air quality and capture main roads traffic conditions through machine learning techniques. The system exposes a mobile application and a website to support the collection of citizens’ reports and show gathered data to both institutions and end-users. A proof-of-concept of the proposed solution has been prototyped in a medium-sized university campus. Both the performance and functional validation have demonstrated the feasibility and the effectiveness of the system and allowed the definition of some lessons learned, as well as future works. © 2022 by the authors.

A multi-procedure intelligent algorithm for weight training using two inertial measurement units (IMUs) is proposed in this paper. The first procedure is for motion tracking that estimates the arm orientation and calculates the positions of the wrist and elbow. The second procedure is for posture recognition based on deep learning, which identifies the type of exercise posture. The final procedure is for exercise prescription variables, which first infers the user’s exercise state based on the results of the previous two procedures, triggers the corresponding event, and calculates the key indicators of the weight training exercise (exercise prescription variables), including exercise items, repetitions, sets, training capacity, workout capacity, training period, explosive power, etc.). This study integrates the hardware and software as a complete system. The developed smartphone App is able to receive heart rate data, to analyze the user’s exercise state, and to calculate the exercise prescription variables auto-matically in real-time. The dashboard in the user interface of the smartphone App can display exercise information through Unity’s Animation System (avatar) and graphics, and records are stored by the SQLite database. The designed system was proven by two types of experimental verification tests. The first type is to control a stepper motor to rotate the designed IMU and to compare the rotation angle obtained from the IMU with the rotation angle of the controlled stepper motor. The average mean absolute error of estimation for 31 repeated experiments is 1.485 degrees. The second type is to use Mediapipe Pose to calculate the position of the wrist and the angles of upper arm and forearm between the Z-axis, and these calculated data are compared with the designed system. The root-mean-square (RMS) error of positions of the wrist is 2.43 cm, and the RMS errors of two angles are 5.654 and 4.385 degrees for upper arm and forearm, respectively. For posture recognition, 12 participants were di-vided into training group and test group. Eighty percent and 20% of 24,963 samples of 10 participants were used for the training and validation of the LSTM model, respectively. Three-thousand-three-hundred-and-fifty-nine samples of two participants were used to evaluate the performance of the trained LSTM model. The accuracy reached 99%, and F1 score was 0.99. When compared with the other LSTM-based variants, the accuracy of one-layer LSTM presented in this paper is still promising. The exercise prescription variables provided by the presented system are helpful for weight train-ers/trainees to closely keep an eye on their fitness progress and for improving their health. © 2022 by the authors.

The concept of estimating, dynamically, the accuracy of the position estimates provided by an IPS has been sporadically studied in the literature of the field. Recently, this concept has started being studied as well in the context of outdoor positioning systems of Internet of Things (IoT) based on Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs). What is problematic is that the consistent comparison of the proposed methods is quasi nonexistent: new methods rarely use previous ones as baselines; often, a small number of evaluation metrics are reported while different metrics are reported among different relevant publications, the use of open data is rare, and the publication of open code is absent. In this work, we present an open-source, reproducible benchmarking framework for evaluating and consistently comparing various methods of Dynamic Accuracy Estimation (DAE). This work reviews the relevant literature, presenting in a consistent terminology commonalities and differences and discussing baselines and evaluation metrics. Moreover, it evaluates multiple methods of DAE using open data, open code, and a rich set of relevant evaluation metrics.

In this sense, a generic layout has been designed so as to easily achieve communications among the diverse layers by means of simple arithmetic operations, which may result in saving resources in all nodes involved. Traffic forwarding is undertaken by means of forwarding tables within network devices, which need to be searched upon in order to find the proper destination, and that process may be resource-consuming as the number of entries in such tables grow. However, the arithmetic framework proposed may speed up the traffic forwarding decisions as relaying on integer divisions and modular arithmetic, which may result more straightforward.

There is no prior knowledge of actual abnormalities when using UL methods in anomaly detection (AD); hence, a DL-intrusion detection system (IDS)-based on AD depends intensely on their assumption about the distribution of anomalies.

In this study, IoT technology and image sensors are used to rapidly detect indoor environment changes, and a method is proposed to utilize air quality and thermal comfort as the control set‐points. A real‐time ventilation control algorithm is proposed based on the CO2 concentration calculated according to the number of occupants. To check the thermal comfort level, the real‐time operating temperature estimated from the surface temperature data of the infrared array sensor is reflected in the comfort zone defined by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air‐Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).

Recent innovations in telehealth have revolutionized the way HIE takes place, however, some healthcare aspects call for specialized technology that is not covered by existing solutions. At present, many developing countries use Community Health Workers who visit infant homes, conduct check-ups, and give immunization vaccines. However, the large distances and populations involved limit the number of visits to those requiring vaccines only and confine monitoring to parameters measured by portable equipment only. Further, the process involves manual devices and processes, making it prone to errors and delays in interventions. The best practice would be the automation of the monitoring process and real-time data transmission. This study adopted a Design Science Research approach, with a prototype developed and tested in a simulated environment; to investigate how the Internet of Things (IoT) Technology can enhance HIE. Observations of measurements taken by the IoT and analytics server formed the primary quantitative data collection methods. The early results presented show that the prototype generates growth charts and health alerts useful for clinical research and resource planning. The solution showed acceptable accuracy levels, enforced user privacy, and efficiently utilized network resources. The system can import and export data in CVS or JSON formats, enabling it to interoperate with popular health Information systems such as DHIS2. In this way, the findings dissolve boundaries that previously challenged communication in healthcare for marginalized communities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Health information exchange; IoT technology; Remote patient monitoring; Telehealth; Telemedicine","Clinical research; Developing countries; Information dissemination; Internet of things; Medical computing; Remote patient monitoring; Telemedicine; Early warning signs; Growth monitoring; Health information exchange; Health informations; Health monitoring; Information exchanges; Internet of things technologies; Telehealth; United Nations; Well being; Vaccines",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123425143

Although this modernization brings many far-reaching benefits, the hardware and software newly incorporated into the power systems also incur many vulnerabilities. By taking advantage of these vulnerabilities, adversaries can launch various cyber/physical attacks to tamper with electricity meter readings, i.e., to steal electricity. It is reported that total worldwide annual economic losses caused by electricity theft reached up to almost one hundred billion dollars in recent years. With methods to tamper with meter readings becoming more versatile, secret, and flexible, electricity theft tends to get even more serious in modernized power systems. For preventing adversaries from stealing electricity, researchers have done a lot of works. Although some related surveys on these works exist, they are not updated or just discuss electricity theft in a specific region. This survey aims to gain a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the electricity theft issue. After investigating how adversaries tamper with meter readings, we systematically survey all existing detection methods up to date, which is classified into machine learning- and measurement mismatch-based methods.

The aim is to obtain a discreet type of inverse sensor characteristic, with a predefined maximum approximation error, with minimization of the number of points defining the characteristic, which in turn is related to the possibilities for using microcontrollers with limited energy and memory resources. In this context, the results from the study indicate that to overcome the problems arising from the resource constraints of smart devices, appropriate “lightweight” algorithms are needed that allow efficient connectivity and intelligent management of the measurement processes. The method has two ben-efits: first, low‐cost microcontrollers could be used for hardware implementation of the industrial sensor devices; second, the optimal subdivision of the measurement range reduces the space in the memory of the microcontroller necessary for storage of the parameters of the linearized character-istic. Although the discussed computational examples are aimed at building adaptive approximations for temperature sensors, the algorithm can easily be extended to many other sensor types and can improve the performance of resource‐constrained devices. For prescribed maximum approximation error, the inverse sensor characteristic is found directly in the linearized form. Further ad-vantages of the proposed approach are: (i) the maximum error under linearization of the inverse sensor characteristic at all intervals, except in the general case of the last one, is the same; (ii) the approach allows non‐uniform distribution of maximum approximation error, i.e., different maximum approximation errors could be assigned to particular intervals; (iii) the approach allows the application to the general type of differentiable sensor characteristics with piecewise concave/con-vex properties. © 2022 by the authors.

Inspections require an inspector to verify several characteristics of the assets onsite, typically using legacy and poorly digitized procedures. Thus, many research opportunities arise from the adoption of digital technologies to make these procedures more efficient, reliable, and straightforward. In addition to cloud computing, the ubiquitous presence of modern mobile devices, new measurement tools with embedded connectivity capabilities, and blockchain technologies could greatly improve trust and transparency between the stakeholders interested in the inspection. However, there has been little discussion on integrating these technologies into the mining domain. This paper presents and evaluates an end-to-end system to conduct inspections using mobile devices that directly interact with constrained IoT sensor devices. Furthermore, our proposal provides a method to integrate constrained IoT devices as smart measuring tools that directly interact with a blockchain system, guaranteeing data integrity and increasing the trustworthiness of the data.

Many of these facts, which we call “occurrence data”, are known by employees but remain unknown to the company. We suppose that some of them are valuable and may improve the company’s situational awareness. In the spirit of mobile crowdsensing, we propose intra-company crowdsensing (ICC), a method of “extracting” occurrence data from employees. In ICC, an employee occasionally responds to sensing requests, each about one plain fact. We elaborate the concept of ICC, proposing a model of human-system interaction, a system architecture, and an organizational process. We position ICC with respect to related concepts from information technology, and we look at it from selected organizational and managerial viewpoints. Finally, we conducted a survey, in which we presented the concept of ICC to employees of different companies and asked for their evaluation. Respondents positive about ICC outnumbered skeptics by a wide margin. The survey also revealed some concerns, mostly related to ICC being perceived as another employee surveillance tool.

In particular, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become vulnerable to sniffing or jamming attacks because broadcast communication is usually conducted in open-network environments. Although improved security protocols have been proposed to overcome the limitations of wireless-communication technology and to secure safe communication channels, they are difficult to apply to mobile communication networks and IoT because complex hardware is required. Hence, a novel security model with a lighter weight and greater mobility is needed. In this paper, we propose a security model applying cooperative friendly jamming using artificial noise and drone mobility, which are autonomous moving objects, and we demonstrate the prevention of eavesdropping and improved security through simulations and field tests. The Cooperative Friendly Jamming Techniques for Drone-based Mobile Secure Zone (CFJ-DMZ) can set a secure zone in a target area to support a safe wireless mobile communication network through friendly jamming, which can effectively reduce eavesdropping threats.

However, the performance of these schemes in terms of computational and communication/storage cost is not satisfactory. To address this, we propose an Identity-based Computationally Efficient Privacy-Preserving Authentication (ID-CEPPA) scheme using Identity-based Cryptography (IDC) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in VANETs. The scheme ensures message's source authentication, message integrity, non-repudiation, and anonymity of the vehicle's identity efficiently in V2V communications. In addition, our scheme supports batch-signatures verification method due to which multiple messages are authenticated simultaneously. The security of the ID-CEPPA scheme is proved under Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm problem in the random oracle model. The performance evaluation indicates that ID-CEPPA scheme has less computational and communication/storage cost as compared to the relevant IDC-based signature schemes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Integrity; Internet of Things; Privacy-preserving; Unlikability","Authentication; Computational efficiency; Geometry; Network security; Public key cryptography; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Authentication scheme; Computationally efficient; Identity-based; Integrity; Privacy preserving; Privacy-preserving authentication; Security and privacy; Storage costs; Unlikability; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123235244

The Online Predictive Offloading (OPO) algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is proposed to solve the above task offloading decision problem. In the training phase of the model, this algorithm predicts the load of the edge server in real-time with the LSTM algorithm, which effectively improves the convergence accuracy and convergence speed of the DRL algorithm in the offloading process. In the testing phase, the LSTM network is used to predict the characteristics of the next task, and then the computational resources are allocated for the task in advance by the DRL decision model, thus further reducing the response delay of the task and enhancing the offloading performance of the system.

This paper presents an efficient multi-hop routing protocol (EMRP) for efficient data dissemination in IoT-enabled WSNs where hierarchy-based energy-efficient routing is involved. It considers a rank-based next-hop selection mechanism. For each device, it considers the residual energy to choose the route for data exchange. We extracted the residual energy at each node and evaluated it based on the connection degree to validate the maximum rank. It allowed us to identify the time slots for measuring the lifetime of the network. We also considered the battery expiry time of the first node to identify the network expiry time. We validated our work through extensive simulations using Network Simulator. We also implemented TCL scripts and C language code to configure low-power sensing devices, cluster heads and sink nodes.

To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a reputation-driven dynamic node security sharding consensus model (RDSCM) in the blockchain, which consists of two parts: a reputation-driven node to eliminate PBFT (RE-PBFT) and a reputation-driven node cross reconfiguration sharding scheme (NCRS). The RE-PBFT eliminates abnormal nodes in the consensus network and reduces the probability of abnormal nodes becoming master nodes.

The ability of the IoT to collect, analyze and mine data into information and knowledge motivates the integration of IoT with grid and cloud computing. New job scheduling techniques are crucial for the effective integration and management of IoT with grid computing as they provide optimal computational solutions. The computational grid is a modern technology that enables distributed computing to take advantage of a organization’s resources in order to handle complex computational problems. However, the scheduling process is considered an NP-hard problem due to the heterogeneity of resources and management systems in the IoT grid. This paper proposed a Greedy Firefly Algorithm (GFA) for jobs scheduling in the grid environment. In the proposed greedy firefly algorithm, a greedy method is utilized as a local search mechanism to enhance the rate of convergence and efficiency of schedules produced by the standard firefly algorithm. Several experiments were conducted using the GridSim toolkit to evaluate the proposed greedy firefly algorithm’s performance. The study measured several sizes of real grid computing workload traces, starting with lightweight traces with only 500 jobs, then typical with 3000 to 7000 jobs, and finally heavy load containing 8000 to 10,000 jobs. The experiment results revealed that the greedy firefly algorithm could insignificantly reduce the makespan makespan and execution times of the IoT grid scheduling process as compared to other evaluated scheduling methods. Furthermore, the proposed greedy firefly algorithm converges on large search spacefaster, making it suitable for large-scale IoT grid environments. © 2022 by the authors.

It must be carried out frequently and at a multitude of points; thus, the ideal method is to utilize automated monitoring systems, which use sensors based on many transducers, such as Ion Selective Electrodes (ISE). These devices have multiple advantages, but their management via traditional methods (i.e., manual sampling and measurements) is rather complex. Wireless Sensor Networks have been used in these environments, but there is no standard way to take advantage of the benefits of new Internet of Things (IoT) environments. To deal with this, an IoT-based generic architecture for chemical parameter monitoring systems is proposed and applied to the development of an intelligent potassium sensing system, and this is described in detail in this paper. This sensing system provides fast and simple deployment, interference rejection, increased reliability, and easy application development. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method that takes advantage of Cloud services by applying them to the development of a potassium smart sensing system, which is integrated into an IoT environment for use in water monitoring applications.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people with weak immune systems were more likely to die. Regular physical activities and healthy food intake can significantly improve the immune system; however, people with a sedentary lifestyle and a busy job schedule find it challenging and tedious to maintain regularity. Different approaches have been used over the years to engage people in various physical activities and improve their mental and physical health. The concept of employing serious games (games whose primary purpose is not fun or entertainment, but a serious goal) to effectuate better results has become one of the popular choices among healthcare professionals and research communities. Internet of things (IoT) has enabled digital transformation with smart cities, smart infrastructure, and the fourth industrial revolution. There have been some relevant studies on the encouragement of serious games in healthcare in the past few years. However, few research studies encourage IoT-enabled serious games played with IoT devices (sensors and actuators) by making the game experience more ubiquitous and pervasive. Consequently, the adaptation of the IoT in serious games for healthcare applications is a massive gap despite its growing need in an era significantly affected by COVID-19. This paper discusses the possibilities of integrating serious games with IoT and discusses the standard architecture, core technologies, and possible challenges.

With the internet of things (IoT), and especially device-to-device (D2D) cases, the client is supposed to have a very simple structure and low cost. It is also desirable that the client contains minimal software modules specifically for IPS purposes. This study proposes a new IPS technique that satisfies these conditions. The evaluation of the technique was previously executed based on a manual procedure. This technique utilizes Wi-Fi technology in addition to a new design of two orthogonal phased antenna arrays. This paper provides a complete design of a Wi-Fi access point (AP), considered as the proof of concept of a commercial AP. For the system to be fully automatic, the proposed architecture is based on a Raspberry Pi, external Wi-Fi modules, a powered universal serial bus (USB) hub, and two orthogonal phased antenna arrays. The phases of each antenna array are governed by extra-phase circuits as well as a radio frequency (RF) switch. Extensive design parameters have been chosen through parametric sweeps that satisfy the design conditions. Software testing results for the antenna arrays are included in this paper to show the feasibility and suitability of the proposed antenna array for IPS. © 2022 by the authors.

For this, smart agricultural systems and autonomous robots have become widespread. One of the most significant and persistent problems related to robots is 3D path planning, which is an NP-hard problem, for mobile robots. In this paper, efficient methods are proposed by two metaheuristic algorithms (Incremental Gray Wolf Optimization (I-GWO) and Expanded Gray Wolf Optimization (Ex-GWO)). The proposed methods try to find collision-free optimal paths between two points for robots without human intervention in an acceptable time with the lowest process costs and efficient use of resources in large-scale and crowded farmlands. Thanks to the methods proposed in this study, various tasks such as tracking crops can be performed efficiently by autonomous robots. The simulations are carried out using three methods, and the obtained results are compared with each other and analyzed. The relevant results show that in the proposed methods, the mobile robots avoid the obstacles successfully and obtain the optimal path cost from source to destination.

This paper introduces a timestamp-free clock syntonization approach, carrier frequency offset (CFO)-assisted syntonization (CFOSynt), to estimate the clock skew between a pair of nodes by utilizing carrier frequency offset. To enable CFOSynt, we leverage the fact that RF oscillators in the radio can be used as the reference to calibrate the system clock oscillators, and the pairwise RF clock information is carried in the transmission carrier frequency. By incorporating CFO and capturing the clock frequency relationship in system clock skew estimation, CFOSynt can eliminate the need for timestamping and the impact of delay uncertainties. To validate the design, CFOSynt is implemented on two common off-the-shelf (COTS) IoT platforms with access to the CFO estimation from the radio chip.

Most of existing 3D reconstruction methods require a mobile user to walk around the target area and reconstruct objectives with a hand-held camera, which is inefficient and time-consuming. To meet the requirements of delay intensive and resource hungry applications in 5G, we propose an edge computing-based photo crowdsourcing (EC-PCS) framework in this paper. The main objective is to collect a set of representative photos from ubiquitous mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices at the network edge for real-time 3D model reconstruction, with network resource and monetary cost considerations. Specifically, we first propose a photo pricing mechanism by jointly considering their freshness, resolution and data size. Then, we design a novel photo selection scheme to dynamically select a set of photos with the required target coverage and the minimum monetary cost. We prove the NP-hardness of such problem, and develop an efficient greedy-based approximation algorithm to obtain a near-optimal solution. Moreover, an optimal network resource allocation scheme is presented, in order to minimize the maximum uploading delay of the selected photos to the edge server. Finally, a 3D reconstruction algorithm and a 3D model caching scheme are performed by the edge server in real time. Extensive experimental results based on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our EC-PCS system over the existing mechanisms. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","multi-access edge computing; photo crowdsourcing; Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction","3D modeling; Approximation algorithms; Costs; Economics; Image reconstruction; Internet of things; Mobile edge computing; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D models; 3d-modeling; Edge computing; Edge server; Monetary costs; Multi-access edge computing; Multiaccess; Photo crowdsourcing; Real- time; Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction; Augmented reality",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122778457

However, to ensure data privacy, it is necessary to encrypt sensitive data prior to outsourcing. Limitations such as measurement, network delays, and data obfuscation may, however, result in uncertain data. Compared with searching over encrypted certain data, processing queries for encrypted uncertain data is more challenging. In this article, we propose a secure and efficient range query scheme over outsourced encrypted uncertain data, for example, from Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Specifically, we use pivot mapping to map data to a low-dimensional space to facilitate calculation and processing while preserving some of the original relevance among the data. Additionally, we encode data and then map codes into multiple Bloom filters which are organized by a binary tree-based index. Our scheme achieves data privacy, hides the relevance among data, and also supports efficient queries. We analyze the security and evaluate the performance of our approach using experiments on Microsoft Azure.

According to an intelligent and decentralized method, this technology processes data generated by IoT sensors to seamlessly integrate physical and cyber environments. Internet of Things uses wireless and smart objects. They communicate with each other, monitor the environment, collect information, and respond to user requests. These objects have limited energy resources since they use batteries to supply energy. Also, they cannot replace their batteries. As a result, the network lifetime is limited and short. Thus, reducing energy consumption and accelerating the data transmission process are very important challenges in IoT networks to reduce the response time. In the data transmission process, selecting an appropriate cluster head node is very important because it can reduce the delay when sending data to the fog. In this paper, cluster head nodes are selected based on several important criteria such as distance, residual energy, received signal strength, and link expiration time. Then, objects send the processed data to the server hierarchically through a balanced tree.

This study aimed at introducing a new attack called Dropped Destination Advertisement Object (DDAO) and a new Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to counter this attack in RPL protocol. DDAO attack adversely affects the network by preventing the creation of the downward routes through not forwarding Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) messages and sending fake Destination Advertisement Object Acknowledgment (DAO-ACK) messages to the DAO source.

In this work, generalised symmetric maps with adaptive control parameter are presented. This novel idea allows the user to choose any symmetric chaotic map, while ensuring that the output is a stream of independent and random sequences.

Furthermore, because traditional wireless communications are incapable of providing high-speed data rates, 6G enables superior coverage by integrating space/air/underwater networks with terrestrial networks. 5G-and-beyond (5 GB) and 6G networks have been mandated as a paradigm shift to take the enhanced broadband, massive access, and ultra-reliable and low latency services of 5G wireless networks to an even more advanced and intelligent level, to meet the ever-growing quantities of demanding services. In 5G and 6G wireless communication systems, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), has emerged as an essential component of fully intelligent network orchestration and management. 5 GB and 6G communication systems will also rely heavily on a tactile Internet of Things (IoT). The diverse nature of heterogeneous traffic and the established service quality parameters in 5 GB networks will present numerous challenges. Many other wireless technologies, including free space optics (FSO), look promising for meeting the demands of 5 GB systems. FSO has been identified as a promising technology for achieving higher data rates while consuming less power. However, attenuation due to weather, pointing errors, and turbulences limits its performance. Traditional Maximum likelihood decoding techniques require prior channel information to decode the signals. in this paper, first time we proposed a novel decoding technique for decoding on–off keying (OOK) modulated FSO signals using support vector machines (SVM). The model is tested under various atmospheric weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow, as well as turbulence and pointing errors. Simulated numerical results demonstrate that the proposed SVM-based decoding schemes are capable of mitigating attenuation, pointing error, and turbulent channel impairments. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Attenuation; Free space optical communication; Maximum likelihood; Support vector machine; Turbulence","Decoding; Errors; Internet of things; Maximum likelihood; Optical communication; Queueing networks; Support vector machines; Vector spaces; Attenuation; Communications systems; Decoding techniques; Free Space Optical communication; Freespace optics; Ma ximum likelihoods; Maximum-likelihood; Performance enhancements; Pointing errors; Support vectors machine; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122299152

To address this problem, a short-term energy prediction system based on edge computing architecture is proposed, in which data acquisition, data processing and regression prediction are distributed in sensing nodes, routing nodes and central server respectively.

In addition, an online multi-branch network model adapted to the characteristics of IoT data is implemented for energy prediction.

The integration of such sensors, which must be unobstructive and not change the functionality of the poles, is dictated by the ultimate goal of providing a real time biofeedback in two possible scenarios. The first is intended for Nordic Walking's instructors, who have the opportunity to verify the proper practice execution by their trainees through the availability of real time objective data, in addition to their personal experience. The second is devoted to amateur players who can practice alone, after the training session with the instructor, and can independently correct any imperfections in real time using a software tool running on their smartphone.

The proposed scheme uses a three-variable particle structure where the initial two variables specify the BNC coordinates, and the third variable determines the cluster head node.

This led to the development of paradigm fog computing, which facilitates data analysis and processing at the edge. Along with fog, cloud co-exists to provide massive storage, processing resources, etc. However, data storage and computation at multiple levels raise the risk of data security. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a well-known cryptographic technique for providing fine-grained access control. Unfortunately, the existing multi-authority CP-ABE schemes are incompatible with resource-limited IoT devices as the ciphertext and secret key size grow linearly with the number of attributes. Therefore, we propose a multi-authority CP-ABE scheme named MACFI, where the ciphertext and secret key size are efficient. The size of the secret key held by the user is constant irrespective of the number of attributes.

The IoT devices collect sensory data from physical environments and transmit them to the cybers, and the cybers make decisions to respond to the collected data and issue commands to control the IoT devices. It is generally known that energy is an important but limited resource in IoT devices. Data compression is an efficient way to reduce the energy consumption of data collection in sustainable IoT enabled CPSs, especially the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based data compression. The trade-off between data compression ratio and data reconstruction error is one of the biggest challenges for PCA based data compression. In this paper, we investigate PCA based data compression to maximize the compression ratio with bounded reconstruction error for data collection in IoT enabled CPSs. Firstly, a similarity based clustering algorithm is proposed to cluster IoT devices in an IoT enabled CPS. Then, a PCA based data compression algorithm is proposed to compress the collected data to the greatest extent in each cluster with a bounded reconstruction error.

Given rapid population growth and its negative effects on society and the environment, the application of IoT technologies may be regarded as an opportunity to mitigate those negative impacts and increase sustainability. Among various innovations in wireless communication technologies, connected vehicle technologies (CVT) have received increased attention in recent years. However, there is a dearth of studies on CVT and their influences on the sustainability of transportation systems. Therefore, the identification of the most important applications of CVT in the context of sustainable development can provide useful insights for managers and policy-makers to improve the efficiency of transportation systems. To this end, 18 sustainability indicators in transportation systems are identified based on the literature review. The fuzzy DEMATEL-based analytical network process DANP is used to assess interrelationships among sustainability indicators and to determine the importance of each indicator. Then, fuzzy VIKOR is used to rank the CVT applications that would improve sustainability in transportation systems. The findings show that loss reduction, decision support systems, welfare applications, tourism, and entertainment have higher priorities than other applications of CVT in transportation.

To address this, an energy-aware multi-group hybrid MAC (MG-HYMAC) protocol is proposed in this work to improve energy efficiency as well as the lifetime of the biomedical sensor devices in a personalized healthcare system. The proposed protocol combines both the advantages of the CSMA/CA and the TDMA schemes to enable the biomedical sensors to efficiently contend for transmission opportunities and to allow them to efficiently transmit health data. The MG-HYMAC protocol is combined with a transmission scheduling technique to duty cycle the operations of the biomedical devices with less critical data to determine when and how the biomedical sensor devices will transmit their health data packets in order to reduce collisions to save energy and prolong the battery lifetime of the biomedical sensor devices so as to improve the overall network lifetime. Also, a stochastic probability model and a heuristic-based power control scheme are developed to solve time allocation and power control problems to improve energy efficiency and the biomedical sensor devices lifetime. To validate the MG-HYMAC protocol, it was compared with other related protocols (including HyMAC and CPMAC) and simulated in MATLAB.

Reconfigurable PUFs (RPUFs) with dynamically refreshable CRPs can enhance the security and robustness of conventional PUFs. The in-plane current-driven perpendicular polarized nanomagnet switching via spin-orbit torque (SOT) possesses great potential for application to memory and logic, as the write-current path is separate from the read-current path, which naturally resolves the write-read interference. However, the stochastic switching of perpendicular magnetization, without an additional symmetry-breaking field, would significantly hinder the technological viability of commercial implementations. Here, we report an initialization-free physical RPUF implemented by SOT-induced stochastic switching of perpendicularly magnetized Ta/CoFeB/MgO nanodevices.

Such a network formation process relies on nodes passively scanning for advertised Enhanced Beacon (EB) frames to join the network. Doing so, a node wishing to join a TSCH network may stay awake randomly scanning for EBs for a considerable period of time, leading to a lengthy formation process with excessive energy consumption.

Besides, data is often not transmitted smoothly, and the intermediate offline process is complicated. What is worse, the efficiency is low, and the verification cost is high. Therefore, based on supply chain finance, an evolutionary risk model is constructed in this paper. Firstly, the income matrix of the regulatory risk model is established, and the convolutional neural network used will pool the training data to the maximum and set the local corresponding normalization layer. With the help of the evolutionary risk theory, the dynamic equation of the financial supply chain is obtained, forming the dynamic path and abnormal model of strategy selection. Then, a compact pattern tree is added to the knowledge granularity method to mine data anomalies. Finally, an experimental platform is built to verify the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper, and experiments are performed on the accuracy of model evolution conditions, abnormal data identification, and abnormal numerical examples. The experimental results prove that the algorithm in this paper is consistent with the set parameters, and the effect is significantly higher than other comparison methods. The experimental mining time and the comparison method are shortened by 6∼13S. The research results obtained from this paper solve the problem that the decision-making of supply chain finance and the supervision and review of supply chain enterprise are complex, which improves the characteristics identification of supply chain platform, and provides reference suggestions for financial institutions and supply chain platforms. © 2021","Abnormal data; Convolution algorithm; Enterprise of the Internet of Things; Risk model; Supply chain risk","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Finance; Multilayer neural networks; Numerical methods; Risk assessment; Supply chains; Abnormal data; Comparison methods; Convolution algorithm; Convolutional neural network; Enterprise of the internet of thing; Financial supply chains; Risk modeling; Supply chain finances; Supply chain platforms; Supply-chain risks; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120856242

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) forms an important part of IoT. This is a network of sensor nodes that is used in a vast range of applications. WSN is formed by the random deployment of sensor nodes in various fields of interest. The practical fields of deployment can be 2D or 3D, isotropic or anisotropic depending on the application. The localization algorithms must provide accurate localization irrespective of the type of field. In this paper, we have reported a localization algorithm called Range Reduction Based Localization (RRBL). This algorithm utilizes the properties of hop-based and centroid methods to improve the localization accuracy in various types of fields. In this algorithm, the location unknown nodes identify the close-by neighboring nodes within a predefined threshold and localize themselves by identifying and reducing the probable range of existence from these neighboring nodes. The nodes which do not have enough neighbors are localized using the least squares method. The algorithm is tested in various irregular and heterogeneous conditions. The results are compared with a few state-of-the-art hop-based and centroid-based localization techniques.

Achieving high Quality of Service (QoS) in cooperative systems remains a challenging task in LoRa. However, high QoS can be achieved via optimizing the transmission policy parameters such as spreading factor, bandwidth, code rate and carrier frequency. Yet existing approaches have not optimized the complete LoRa parameters. Furthermore, the star of stars topology used by LoRa causes more energy consumption and a low packet reception ratio. Motivated by this, this paper presents transmission policy enforcement and multi-hop routing for QoS-aware LoRa networks (MQ-LoRa). A hybrid cluster root rotated tree topology is constructed in which gateways follow a tree topology and Internet of Things (IoT) nodes follow a cluster topology. A ‘membrane’ inspired form the cell tissues which form clusters to sharing the correct information. The membrane inspired clustering algorithm is developed to form clusters and an optimal header node is selected using the influence score. Data QoS ranking is implemented for IoT nodes where priority and non-priority information is identified by the new field of LoRa frame structure (QRank). The optimal transmission policy enforcement uses fast deep reinforcement learning called Soft Actor Critic (SAC) that utilizes the environmental parameters including QRank, signal quality and signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio. The transmission policy is optimized with respect to the spreading factor, code rate, bandwidth and carrier frequency. Then, a concurrent optimization multi-hop routing algorithm that uses mayfly and shuffled shepherd optimization to rank routes based on the fitness criteria. Finally, a weighted duty cycle is implemented using a multi-weighted sum model to reduce resource wastage and information loss in LoRa IoT networks. Performance evaluation is implemented using a NS3.26 LoRaWAN module. The performance is examined for various metrics such as packet reception ratio, packet rejection ratio, energy consumption, delay and throughput. Experimental results prove that the proposed MQ-LoRa outperforms the well-known LoRa methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Deep reinforcement learning; Internet of Things (IoT); Long Range (loRa) communication; Provisioning multi-hop routing; Quality of Service (QoS); Transmission policy parameters optimization","Bandwidth; Clustering algorithms; Deep learning; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Optimal systems; Reinforcement learning; Signal to noise ratio; Stars; Topology; Internet of thing; Long-range communications; Multi-hop routing; Parameter optimization; Policy enforcement; Provisioning multi-hop routing; Quality of service; Quality-of-service; Transmission policy; Transmission policy parameter optimization; Quality of service",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120672503

However, most current IBPs are designed adopting a centralized system architecture, which fails to achieve a decentralized and effective one to ensure a single point of truth in BIM and prevent a single point of failure in IoT networks. To address this challenge, this study introduces permissioned blockchain with IBP and proposes a novel service-oriented system architecture of blockchain-enabled IoT-BIM platform (BIBP) for the data-information-knowledge (DIK)-driven supply chain management in modular construction. First, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is designed with hardware, core technologies, and protocols to offer accurate data from daily practice to blockchain BIM. Blockchain BIM as a service (BaaS) is then developed within the permissioned blockchain to ease the interoperability of the information, semantics, and meaningful inferences. Furthermore, software as a service (SaaS) is configured with decentralized applications to achieve knowledgeable operations or processes with a crash fault-tolerant consensus mechanism. The demonstrative case study in a modular student residence project evaluates the proposed BIBP system prototype with the performance analysis of storage cost, throughput, latency, privacy, and feedback from stakeholders. The results indicate that BIBP has an effective system architecture with acceptable throughput and latency, can save storage costs to achieve a single point of truth in BIM, and avoid a single point of failure for IoT networks with privacy and security-preserving mechanisms. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Blockchain; Building information modeling (BIM); Internet of Things (IoT); Modular construction; Supply chain management","Application programs; Architectural design; Computer architecture; Cost benefit analysis; Digital storage; Information management; Information services; Information theory; Interoperability; Modular construction; Network architecture; Semantics; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Supply chain management; Web services; Block-chain; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Decentralised; In-buildings; Internet of thing; Modeling platforms; Single point; Storage costs; Systems architecture; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120520950

Hence, object identification is a significant issue as some bogus objects may take part for malicious access. Considering this situation, RFID can be used for unique identification and validation of IoT objects. However, it recognizes many objects at the same time and faces limitations like non-repudiations, injection of fake objects, and unclonability issues. Alternatively, security limitations between tags and readers are analyzed and found that whole communication depends on limited computational resource and simple operations such as hash function, XOR operation, and so forth. Moreover, the communication channel between reader and backend server is secure due to symmetric or asymmetric key encryption algorithms. As the information is exchanged by the tags with readers, a secure path must be maintained among them for safe communication with cloud server. For the development of secure path and verification of objects, ECC-based Cramer-Shoup encryption, cryptographic authentication protocol (CAP), and device fingerprinting can be used. To overcome the existing limitations, we are motivated to design an ECC-based secure object tracking and key exchange protocol that allows the owner device to be offline during communication.

In this research work, we study LoRaWan and Wi-Fi as two possible candidates for data transmission. We are particularly focused on the study of the above technologies in terms of performance as well as application development that can be used as rescue monitoring systems. For this reason, we start by describing LoRa as an ideal low power and long-distance communication protocol on the IoT devices compared to the Wi-Fi network. We perform various simulations in terms of time on air transmission, bit error rate by changing important metrics to study the behavior of the whole mechanism.

Various Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Building Information Modelling (BIM) platforms have been developed to facilitate production management by providing better information visibility, traceability, and a more collaborative working environment. Nevertheless, by and large, existing platforms suffer from two shortcomings: (a) the ‘single point of failure’ problem of IoT networks and (b) how to guarantee the provenance of BIM modifications from multi-sources. This research aims to develop a blockchain-enabled IoT-BIM platform (BIBP) for off-site production management in modular construction (OPM-MC) that can overcome the shortcomings. A design science research method is adopted to develop a three-layer BIBP system architecture. The system architecture is implemented and then compared with the existing IoT-enabled BIM platform. It was found that BIBP can avoid a single point of failure in IoT networks and ensure the provenance of BIM modifications with reduced storage costs in OPM-MC. The system architecture developed in our study can help the industry advance beyond the rhetoric to develop practical blockchain-enabled IoT-BIM applications.

RPL is one such popular routing protocol for IoT devices and systems. However, security in RPL is an afterthought, and it does not meet the demands of today's complex cyberthreat landscape. Focusing on sybil attack detection in RPL-based IoT, we first propose a lightweight Bloom filter and physical unclonable function (PUF) based sybil attack detection mechanism (hereafter referred to as liteSAD). Our approach is designed to minimize memory cost as well as detection latency, without affecting the detection accuracy. Specifically, in liteSAD, Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root generates a Bloom filter array through hashing each legitimate node's identifier and PUF response, and distributes it through a new packet named BF-DAO. Upon receiving the BF-DAO packet, each legitimate node retrieves the Bloom filter array, updates its local copy, and employs it to detect sybil attack. We also propose a probabilistic DIO reply mechanism (i.e., proDIO) to reduce the number of broadcasted DIO packets in response to attack DIS packets. We investigate the setting of Bloom filter parameters that minimize the probability of false positive and time complexity while meeting the requirement of memory constraints in IoT devices. We also evaluate the performance of our mechanism liteSAD+proDIO through extensive simulation experiments, where the results demonstrate that liteSAD+proDIO can provide better performance in terms of detection rate, detection latency, miss detection rate, DIO Trickle timer, number of broadcasted DIO packets, and energy consumption. In summary, our major contributions are twofold: (i) the comprehensive analysis of RPL routing protocol, Trickle algorithm, and the impact of sybil attack; and (ii) the proposal of lightweight Bloom filter and PUF based sybil attack detection mechanism. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bloom filter; IoT; Lightweight detection; Physical unclonable function; Sybil attack","Computer crime; Cryptography; Directed graphs; Energy utilization; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Attack detection; Bloom filters; Detection latency; Detection mechanism; Detection rates; Filter arrays; Lightweight detection; Performance; Routing-protocol; Sybil attack; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119446441

However, the power supplies for countless sensors become a serious issue to suppress further expansion of IoT. In this work, a self-powered triboelectric sensor (CN-STS) made of electrospun composite nanofibers is developed towards smart traffic monitoring and management. To meet the requirements of fast-response and high sensitivity for the smart traffic management, transferred charge density is adopted as sensing signals compared to voltage / current outputs for it can perfectly record the subtle differences and suitable for dynamic traffic monitoring. Carbon nanotube is further doped into PVDF nanofibers to improve the electrical output performance and pressure sensitivity. A relatively high sensitivity of 0.0406 μCm−2kPa−1 at low pressure range (0–75 kPa) and a sensitivity of 0.0032 μCm−2kPa−1 at higher pressure range (75–425 kPa) can be achieved by the CN-STS, indicating that the CN-STS is more sensitive at low pressure range. Moreover, by connecting to cloud IoT services, the functions of traffic flow management, overlapping and speeding vehicle capturing, and plate number recognition are realized by the CN-STS arrays with a compensation circuit. A charge amplifier is utilized in power management to process the charge input signals for better distinguishing the signals from none-vehicles and stabilize the volage output for further reading by the A/D convertor build in Raspberry Pi.

To improve accuracy, a large number of different types of features will be extracted from malware files in these methods. That brings a high complexity to the classification. To solve these issues, a malware classification method based on Word2Vec and Multilayer Perception (MLP) is proposed in this article. First, for one malware sample, Word2Vec is used to calculate a word vector for all bytes of the binary file and all instructions in the assembly file. Second, we combine these vectors into a 256x256x2-dimensional matrix. Finally, we designed a deep learning network structure based on MLP to train the model. Then the model is used to classify the testing samples. The experimental results prove that the method has a high accuracy of 99.54%. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","IoT; Malware classification; multilayer perception; Word2Vec","Deep learning; Malware; Multilayers; Assembly files; Binary files; Classification methods; Explosive growth; Feature engineerings; High complexity; Malware classifications; Multi-layer perception; Word vectors; Word2vec; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119209184

The fast growing of edge devices makes it difficult for cloud systems to process all data and jobs originating from edge devices, which leads to the development of edge computing by completing jobs on edges instead of clouds. Unfortunately, edge devices generally possess only limited computing power. Therefore, jobs demanding heavy computation under strict time constraints could have more difficulties to successfully complete their work on edges than on clouds in the Cloud-to-Edge continuum. If cloud systems could dynamically orchestrate cloud resources to expedite the execution of those jobs, not only their timely execution could be assured, also the loading of edge devices could be reduced. The Apache Hadoop is considered one of the most popular cloud systems in industry and academia. However, it does not support dynamic resource allocation. Previously we proposed and implemented a new model which can dynamically adjust the computing resources assigned to given jobs in the Hadoop cloud system to speed up their execution. Like other computer software, cloud systems completely rely on their underlying operating systems to access hardware components such as CPUs and hard drives. In this paper, we report our efforts to improve our model to collaborate with the Linux operating system to accelerate the execution of jobs with high priority to a greater extent. Compared with what our original model achieved, experiments show that our ameliorated model could further quicken the execution of prioritized jobs in Hadoop by up to around 21%. As a result, jobs from edges that require substantial computing resources promptly could have better chances to get accomplished on cloud systems. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Cloud computing; Edge computing; Hadoop; HDFS","Computer operating systems; Digital storage; Internet of things; Program processors; Cloud systems; Cloud-computing; Computing power; Computing resource; Cutting edges; Dynamic resources; Edge computing; Hadoop; HDFS; Research areas; Edge computing",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119208493

This requires an alternative approach to protect vulnerable components in IoT networks. In this article, we propose an integrated defense technique to achieve intrusion prevention by leveraging cyberdeception (i.e., a decoy system) and moving target defense (i.e., network topology shuffling). We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed technique analytically based on a graphical security model in a software-defined networking (SDN)-based IoT network. We develop four strategies (i.e., fixed/random and adaptive/hybrid) to address ""when""to perform network topology shuffling and three strategies (i.e., genetic algorithm/decoy attack path-based optimization/random) to address ""how""to perform network topology shuffling on a decoy-populated IoT network, and we analyze which strategy can best achieve a system goal, such as prolonging the system lifetime, maximizing deception effectiveness, maximizing service availability, or minimizing defense cost. We demonstrated that a software-defined IoT network running our intrusion prevention technique at the optimal parameter setting prolongs system lifetime, increases attack complexity of compromising critical nodes, and maintains superior service availability compared with a counterpart IoT network without running our intrusion prevention technique. Further, when given a single goal or a multi-objective goal (e.g., maximizing the system lifetime and service availability while minimizing the defense cost) as input, the best combination of ""when""and ""how""strategies is identified for executing our proposed technique under which the specified goal can be best achieved. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","graphical security models; Internet-of-Things; moving target defense; software defined networking","Cybersecurity; Genetic algorithms; Network security; Software defined networking; Topology; Defense costs; Graphical security model; Intrusion prevention; Moving target defense; Network topology; Prevention techniques; Security modeling; Services availability; Software-defined networkings; System lifetimes; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119197643

Our survey of 237 participants found that users do not understand that skills are often operated by third parties, that they often confuse third-party skills with native Alexa functions, and that they are unaware of the functions that the native Alexa system supports. Surprisingly, users who interact with Alexa more frequently are more likely to conclude that a third-party skill is a native Alexa function. The potential for misunderstanding creates new security and privacy risks: attackers can develop third-party skills that operate without users' knowledge or masquerade as native Alexa functions. To mitigate this threat, we make design recommendations to help users better distinguish native functionality and third-party skills, including audio and visual indicators of native and third-party contexts, as well as a consistent design standard to help users learn what functions are and are not possible on Alexa. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","Internet of Things; network measurement; privacy; security; Smart home","Automation; Data privacy; Intelligent buildings; Network security; Surveys; User interfaces; Network measurement; Privacy; Security; Security and privacy; Security risks; Smart homes; Systems support; Third parties; Third party application (Apps); Voice user interface; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119174171

We refer to these processes as IoT-enhanced BPs. Although numerous researchers have studied this subject, there are still some challenges to be faced. For instance, the need of a modelling solution that does not increase the notation complexity to facilitate further analysis and engineering decision making, or an execution approach that provides a high degree of independence between the process and the underlying IoT device technology. The objective of this work is defining an approach that (1) considers important intrinsic characteristics of IoT-enhanced BPs at modelling level without growing the complexity of the modelling language, and (2) facilitates the execution of the IoT-enhanced BPs represented in models independently from IoT devices’ technology. To do so, we present a modelling approach that uses standard BPMN concepts to model IoT-enhanced BPs without modifying its metamodel. It applies the Separation of Concern (SoC) design principle: BPMN is used to describe IoT-enhanced BPs while low-level real-world data is captured in an ontology. Finally, a microservice architecture is proposed to execute BPMN models and facilitate its integration with the physical world. This architecture provides high flexibility to support multiples IoT device technologies as well as their evolution and maintenance. The evaluation done allows us to conclude that the application of the SoC principle using BPMN and ontologies facilitates the definition of intrinsic characteristics of IoT-enhanced BPs without increasing the complexity of the BPMN metamodel.

A hyperconnected city logistics system is conceptualized as the final segment of a PI-network. It uses regional and city hubs as the final leg of last-mile delivery.

Adopting the proposed framework can formulate a Total Inbound Synchronization at three levels: order synchronization, process synchronization and information synchronization. Simulation results show a significant reduction of traveling distance in PI-hubs if the interdependent order fulfillment and replenishment operations are considered as a joint operation.

Limited communication bandwidth becomes a major bottleneck for aggregating local models in FL. Therefore, we use fast global model aggregation based on over-the-air computation (Aircomp). Wireless data transmission consumes most of the power of the edge nodes compared with the energy consumption required for sensing and processing data. Optimizing the transmission power of nodes can significantly save system power. To the best of our knowledge, in most of the research works on FL, the optimum design of system parameters usually takes the peak power of each sensor as the constraint condition. In this paper, the sum power constraint of edge devices is innovatively proposed to minimize the aggregation error of FL. We also study the optimization problem to minimize the total power of all edge sensors in the FL system under certain aggregation error constraints. Unfortunately, these problems presented are nonconvex biquadratic programming problems that are very difficult to solve. Therefore, we propose an alternative optimization method based on the difference-of-convex algorithm.

Traditionally, computer memory organization is ‘static’—i.e. it does not change based on the application-specific characteristics in memory access behaviour during system operation. Specifically, in the case of a content-operated memory (COM), the association of a data block with a search pattern (or cues) and the granularity (details) of a stored data do not evolve. Such a static nature of computer memory, we observe, not only limits the amount of data we can store in a given physical storage, but it also misses the opportunity for performance improvement in various applications. On the contrary, human memory is characterized by seemingly infinite plasticity in storing and retrieving data—as well as dynamically creating/updating the associations between data and corresponding cues. In this paper, we introduce BINGO, a brain-inspired learning memory paradigm that organizes the memory as a flexible neural memory network. In BINGO, the network structure, strength of associations, and granularity of the data adjust continuously during system operation, providing unprecedented plasticity and performance benefits.

Real-time sensor monitoring proves to be a key tool for reducing the risk related to these ever-evolving earth-fill structures, that exhibit a high rate of sudden and hazardous failures. In order to optimally exploit real-time embankment monitoring, one major hindrance has to be overcome: the creation of a supporting numerical model for stability analysis, with rapid-enough response to perform data assimilation in real time. A model should be built, such that its response can be obtained faster than the physical evolution of the analyzed phenomenon. In this work, Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) is used to boost computational efficiency in solving the coupled hydro-mechanical system of equations governing the problem. The Reduced Basis method is applied to the coupled hydro-mechanical equations that govern the groundwater flow, that are made non-linear as a result of considering an unsaturated soil. The resulting model's performance is assessed by solving a 2D and a 3D problem relevant to tailings dams safety. The ROM technique achieves a speedup of 3 to 15 times with respect to the full-order model (FOM) while maintaining high levels of accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Coupled problem; Hydro-mechanical; Model Order Reduction; Non-linear problems; Reduced Basis Method; Tailings dam","Computational efficiency; Embankment dams; Groundwater; Safety engineering; Coupled hydro mechanicals; Coupled problems; Dam safety; Hydro-mechanical; Model order reduction; Nonlinear problems; Real- time; Real-time assessment; Reduced basis methods; Tailing dam; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117371374

Recently, several stochastic variance reduced ADMM algorithms (e.g., SVRG-ADMM) have made exciting progress, such as linear convergence for strongly convex (SC) problems. However, SVRG-ADMM and its variants have an outer loop where the full gradient at the snapshot is computed, and their outer loop contains an inner loop, in which a large number of variance reduced gradients are estimated from random samples. This loopy design makes these methods more complex to analyze and determine the inner loop length, which must be proportional to the condition number to achieve best convergence, and is often set to O(n) as a suboptimal choice, where n is the number of samples. To tackle these issues, we propose an efficient loopless variance reduced stochastic ADMM algorithm, called LVR-SADMM. In our LVR-SADMM, we remove the outer loop and replace it with a biased coin-flip, in which we update the snapshot with a small probability to trigger the full gradient computation. Moreover, we also theoretically analyze the convergence property of LVR-SADMM, which shows that it enjoys a fast linear convergence rate for SC problems. In particular, we also present an accelerated loopless SVRG-ADMM (LAVR-SADMM) method for both SC and non-SC problems. Various experimental results on many real-world data sets verify that the proposed methods can achieve an average speedup of 2 × in the SC case and 5 × in the non-SC case over their loopy counterparts, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.","Convergence; Convex functions; Internet of Things; Minimization; Optimization methods; Training; Upper bound","Constrained optimization; Functions; Number theory; Stochastic systems; Alternating directions method of multipliers; Convergence; Convex functions; Convex problems; Loopless; Minimisation; Optimization method; Outer loop; Stochastics; Upper Bound; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117129797

Existing approaches rely on the domain knowledge of security experts to identify the behavioural patterns, categorise and classify cyber attacks. We proposed an Autoencoder (AE)-based feature construction approach to remove the dependency of manually correlating commands and generate an efficient representation by automatically learning the semantic similarity between input features extracted through commands data. We applied three clustering algorithms, i.e., K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models and Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, on our data set of AE features. We discussed the clustering arrangements for understanding the impact of changes in commands on behavioural patterns of attacks and how attacks are grouped in the same or different clusters. Evaluation of our feature construction approach shows that the clustering algorithm grouped attacks with more common features values compared to clustering with original features. Moreover, we performed a comparative analysis of two existing feature extraction approaches on our data set considering the type of analysis in the process, generalisability of applying features, coverage to the data set and clustering arrangements. We found that challenges identified in applying existing approaches can be addressed with our proposed approach and improving features with AE resulted in providing meaningful clustering interpretations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Autoencoder; Clustering; Feature construction; IoT attacks","K-means clustering; Learning systems; Network security; Semantics; Auto encoders; Behavioral patterns; Clusterings; Construction approaches; Data set; Domain knowledge; Feature construction; IoT attack; Security experts; Semantic similarity; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117112102

Such CLSCs are subject to many uncertainties in their flows given the varying conditions of EOL products. In the era of Industry 4.0, developments in the field of the internet of things (IoT) allow the collection of data throughout full product life cycles to determine most optimal treatments to apply after product recovery. This study proposes a CLSC model maximizing the total profit of the manufacturing company by selecting the treatment to be applied to the collected products according to their condition as estimated by life cycle data collection enabled by IoT. A mixed integer linear programming model is considered for a modular product sharing standard components. To validate the proposed CLSC model on an actual innovative real-world application, we used a modular smartphone as case study. The developed model proposes a solution for the return loop of a CLSC to meet a refurbished product demand over multiple periods. The interest of using intelligent devices that predict the degradation of products during their life cycle is highlighted. The full implementation of such intelligent tracking technology on all products, and not only partially, would be beneficial by more than 5.3% for high remanufacturing costs.

It is important to detect seizures in real time, which can be achieved in an internet of things (IoT)-based cloud platform to alert patients of impending seizures. Therefore, in this study, we propose a new model to recognize seizure states (e.g., ictal, preictal, interictal) from EEG in the IoT framework to monitor patients remotely. The proposed model uses an efficient hybrid genetic whale optimization algorithm (GWOA) based on naïve Bayes (NB-GWOA) for feature selection, and an adaptive extreme learning machine (ELM) based on a differential evolutionary (DE) algorithm (DEELM) for classification. In the NB-GWOA method, the genetic algorithm serves to enhance the exploitation of the whale optimization algorithm in the search of the optimal solutions, while the naïve Bayes method is used to determine a fitness function to assess every agent in the search space. GWOA has strong robustness and is capable of finding the best solutions in less than five iterations, so it is suitable for selecting discriminative features from a huge number of neurofeatures obtained from EEG. Further, the classification model is constructed based on ELM, which uses the DE algorithm for a fast and efficient learning solution. Results show that the proposed NB-GWOA-DEELM model can avoid over- and under-fitting and can provide better and more accurate performance in classifying seizure states from EEG than its competitors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Electroencephalogram; Epilepsy; Extreme learning machine; Optimization; WOA","Electroencephalography; Genetic algorithms; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Neurophysiology; Patient monitoring; Adaptive machine learning; Bayesian; Cloud platforms; Differential evolutionary algorithm; Naive bayes; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Optimizers; Real- time; WOA; Knowledge acquisition",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116565461

However, when an edge server needs to serve excessive app users concurrently, severe interference is incurred, which immediately reduces app users' achievable data rates and, consequently, impacts their perceived service quality. This is a major challenge to the app vendor's attempt to minimize the edge resources required for serving its app users with a satisfactory service quality. To tackle this challenge, in this article, we present and formulate this multiple edge application deployment (MEAD) problem in the MEC environment, aiming to maximize app users' overall service quality at minimum deployment cost, considering application shareability and communication interference. We prove that the MEAD problem is NP-hard. Then, we propose a heuristic approach, namely, the deployment-priority greedy via the divide-and-conquer strategy (DPG-D&C), to solve the MEAD problem effectively and efficiently. We evaluate our approach extensively by using a widely used real-world data set. The experimental results show that DPG-D&C significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. © 2021 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Edge computing; Interference; Internet of Things; Optimization; Quality of experience; Servers","Heuristic methods; Internet of things; Mobile edge computing; Optimization; Application deployment; Cloud-computing; Computing environments; Deployment problems; Divide-and-conquer; Edge computing; Edge server; Interference; Optimisations; Service Quality; Quality of service",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116274582

To ensure data security in edge computing, sensitive data should be encrypted before being outsourced to edge servers. Public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) can provide search service for encrypted data. Nevertheless, most existing PEKS schemes are susceptible to quantum attacks because their security assumptions are based on traditional hardness assumptions. Moreover, many lattice-based PEKS schemes only apply to the single-user scenario, limiting the range of applications. In this paper, we present an efficient lattice-based public key searchable encryption with fine-grained access control for edge computing. Our scheme achieves post-quantum security and highly flexible access control policies for multi-user applications, by utilizing the learning with errors (LWE) assumption and subset predicate encryption.

Within this process, already existing load cells were substituted and additional inductive and magnetic displacement sensors were applied. After calibration, those were fully integrated into a six-layer digitalization architecture at the Smart Forming Lab at the Chair of Metal Forming (Montanuniversitaet Leoben). Within this framework, two front end human machine interfaces were designed, where the first one serves as a condition monitoring system during the rolling process. The second user interface visualizes the result of a resilient machine learning algorithm, which was designed using Python and is not just able to predict and adapt the resulting rolling schedule of a defined metal sheet, but also to learn from additional rolling mill schedules carried out. This algorithm was created on the basis of a black box approach, using data from more than 1900 milling steps with varying roll gap height, sheet width and friction conditions. As a result, the developed program is able to interpolate and extrapolate between these parameters as well as different initial sheet thicknesses, serving as a digital twin for data-based recommendations on schedule changes between different rolling process steps. Furthermore, via the second user interface, it is possible to visualize the influence of this parameters on the result of the milling process. As the whole layer system runs on an internal server at the university, students and other interested parties are able to access the visualization and can therefore use the environment to deepen their knowledge within the characteristics and influence of the sheet metal rolling process as well as data science and especially fundamentals of machine learning. This algorithm also serves as a basis for further integration of materials science based data for the prediction of the influence of different materials on the rolling result. To do so, the rolled specimens were also analyzed regarding the influence of the plastic strain path on their mechanical properties, including anisotropy and materials’ strength. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cyber physical production system; Digital twin; Digitalization; Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Retrofitting; Smart Forming Lab","Aggregates; Anomaly detection; Cyber Physical System; Data visualization; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Sheet metal; Strain; Structural health monitoring; User interfaces; Cell/B.E; Cybe physical production system; Cyber physicals; Digitalization; Fully integrated; Load cells; Production system; Rolling process; Smart forming lab; Stand -alone; Machine learning",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116071749

In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection model that uses machine learning to effectively detect cyber-attacks and anomalies in resource-constraint IoT networks. Through a set of optimizations including removal of multicollinearity, sampling, and dimensionality reduction, our model can identify the most important features to detect intrusions using much fewer training data and less training time. Extensive experiments were performed on the CICIDS2017 and NSL-KDD datasets respectively to evaluate the proposed approach. The experimental results on two popular datasets show that our model has a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. It outperforms existing models in multiple performance metrics and is consistent in classifying major cyber-attacks, respectively. Most importantly, unlike traditional resource-intensive intrusion detection systems, the proposed model is lightweight and can be deployed on IoT nodes with limited power and storage capabilities. © 2021","Intrusion detection; IoT network; Machine learning; Security","Computer crime; Crime; Digital storage; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network security; Regression analysis; Detection mechanism; Internet of thing network; Intrusion detection models; Intrusion-Detection; Optimisations; Resource Constraint; Security; Security breaches; Security vulnerabilities; Specific protocol; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115908379

However, when implementing water-saving strategies, it is necessary to monitor soil and/or plant water status in order to determine crop water demand. A plethora of devices providing indirect measurements of volumetric soil water content, such as the “drill and drop” multi-sensors probes (Sentek, Inc., Stepney, Australia), have been developed over the last decade. The objective of the paper was to analyse time-series of soil water content profiles and meteorological data collected in an adult citrus orchard over three years of field observations (2017–2020) in order to estimate actual crop evapotranspiration and derive crop coefficients. Simultaneous measurements of sap fluxes also allowed for the estimation of the basal crop coefficient, Kcb, used as a control variable. The temporal dynamics of soil water content profiles following rainfall or irrigation events provided information on soil evaporation, root water uptake, and actual crop transpiration. After soil wetting events, in particular, it was possible to recognize patterns of actual crop evapotranspiration similar to those detected with sap flow sensors. The knowledge of actual crop evapotranspiration at the daily time-step, in conjunction with the corresponding reference crop evapotranspiration, allowed for appropriate estimations of the crop coefficient associated with the various development stages. The proposed method provided interesting insights into the dynamics of root water uptake and crop evapotranspiration of the studied citrus orchard, and it represents a promising tool for precise irrigation scheduling in other agroecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Crop coefficient; Evapotranspiration; Internet of Things; Root water uptake; Sap flow; Soil moisture dynamic","Crops; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Internet of things; Irrigation; Meteorology; Orchards; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Transpiration; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Agro-ecosystems; Citrus orchards; Crop coefficient; Crop evapotranspiration; Measurements of; Root-water uptake; Sap flow; Soil moisture dynamics; Soil water content; Water content profiles; Evapotranspiration; agricultural ecosystem; crop production; crop yield; detection method; evapotranspiration; irrigation system; orchard; perennial plant; sap flow; soil water; water content; water demand; water use; agroecosystem; Article; climate; controlled study; evapotranspiration; grass; irrigation (agriculture); mandarin; mathematical model; nonhuman; orchard; plant development; plant root; sap flow; soil water content; time series analysis; water transport; Citrus; crop; irrigation (agriculture); soil; Australia; Citrus; Varanidae; water; Agricultural Irrigation; Citrus; Crops, Agricultural; Plant Transpiration; Soil; Water",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115888238

The exponential growth of cars number badly impacts the transportation system (TS) on which most cities are living on. Traffic control is one of the most critical issues in TS, which depends on a set of cooperative traffic lights. Smart Traffic lights, which can receive and analyze traffic data, can solve traffic problems by efficiently predict the accurate waiting time for each traffic lane at the intersections. This can improve the traffic flow and accordingly promotes the transportation system performance. This paper introduces a Fog-Based Traffic Light Management Strategy (TLMS) based on Fuzzy Inference Engine. TLMS can accurately calculate the optimal waiting time for each traffic lane at the intersections to decrease the average waiting time for the stopped vehicles. TLMS applies Vehicle to infrastructure protocol (V2I) that allows vehicles to interact directly with the infrastructure of the road such as GPS sensors and the traffic light signals. At each traffic intersection, the number of waiting vehicles, their locations relative to TLMS, and their sizes are detected and sent to TLMS in real time. Then, based on fuzzy inference, TLMS can calculate the optimal waiting time for each lane, which optimizes the traffic flow at the intersection by minimizing the waiting time for the vehicles. The performance of the proposed TLMS has been compared and tested against recently proposed techniques via simulation. The results of the experiment showed that TLMS outperforms recent technologies as it minimizes the average waiting time of vehicles around the intersections and accordingly maximizes the performance of the traffic system. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Fog computing; Fuzzy; GPS; IoT; Smart city; Traffic light; Traffic management","Engines; Fog; Fog computing; Fuzzy inference; Smart city; Street traffic control; Traffic signals; Fuzzy; Fuzzy inference engines; Management strategies; Traffic flow; Traffic lanes; Traffic light; Traffic light managements; Traffic management; Transportation system; Waiting time; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115651192

In fact, data-driven intelligent automation systems have been common in the industrial community. Nevertheless, how to effectively store the collected stream data and ensure their integrity is still challenging. To this end, the notion of verifiable data streaming (VDS) protocol, which enables a client to outsource the stream data to an untrusted server in a verifiable manner, was introduced. However, we argue that existing VDS protocols based on the chameleon authentication tree (CAT) are inefficient in the data update, since the whole CAT must be updated accordingly to avoid acute exposure of chameleon hashing. Thus, they are infeasible for intelligent automation systems that need to frequently update data. In this article, we first introduce a new primitive called double-trapdoor chameleon hash tree (DCHT) based on the double-trapdoor chameleon hash families, where each leaf of DCHT is calculated and fixed by using a double-trapdoor chameleon hash family, making the entire DCHT always unchanged. Furthermore, we propose a novel VDS protocol based on the DCHT.

In WSNs, multi-channel protocols have been developed to overcome some limitations related to the throughput and delivery rate which have become necessary for many IoT applications that require sufficient bandwidth to transmit a large amount of data. However, the requirement of frequent negotiation for channel assignment in distributed multi-channel protocols incurs an extra-large communication overhead which results in a reduction of the network lifetime. To deal with this requirement in an energy-efficient way is a challenging task. Hence, the Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for channel assignment is used to overcome this problem. Nevertheless, the use of the RL approach requires a number of iterations to obtain the best solution which in turn creates a communication overhead and time-wasting. In this paper, a Self-schedule based Cooperative multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Channel Assignment (SCRL CA) approach is proposed to improve the network lifetime and performance. The proposal addresses both regular traffic scheduling and assignment of the available orthogonal channels in an energy-efficient way. We solve the cooperation between the RL agents problem by using the self-schedule method to accelerate the RL iterations, reduce the communication overhead and balance the energy consumption in the route selection process. Therefore, two algorithms are proposed, the first one is for the Static channel assignment (SSCRL CA) while the second one is for the Dynamic channel assignment (DSCRL CA). The results of extensive simulation experiments show the effectiveness of our approach in improving the network lifetime and performance through the two algorithms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","IoT; Multi-channel; Reinforcement learning; Self-schedule; Wireless sensor networks","Cooperative communication; Cost reduction; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Communication overheads; Dynamic channel assignment; Extensive simulations; Internet of thing (IOT); Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multichannel communication; Number of iterations; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115062431

Here, the linearity of produced random values is decreased for each clock cycle based on the switching characteristics of the selection line in DIES. Moreover, the linear feedback shift register is used in the adaptive physically unclonable function (APUF) for generating the random response value. The APUF–DIES-IoT architecture is analyzed in terms of lookup table, flip flops, slices, frequency and delay. This APUF–DIES-IoT architecture is analyzed for different security and authentication performances. Two existing methods are considered to evaluate the APUF–DIES-IoT architecture such as TFA-PUF-IoT and TFA-APUF-IoT. The APUF–DIES-IoT architecture uses 36 flip flops at Virtex 6; it is less when compared to the TFA-PUF-IoT and TFA-APUF-IoT. © 2021, The Author(s).","Adaptive physically unclonable function; Data inverting encoding scheme; Internet of things; Linear feedback shift register; One-time alias identity; Two-factor authentication","Authentication; Cryptography; Digital storage; Flip flop circuits; Network architecture; Network security; Shift registers; Table lookup; Authentication protocols; Internet of thing (IoTs); Iot architectures; Linear feedback shift registers; Physically unclonable functions; Substitution boxes; Switching characteristics; Two factor authentication; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114138724

Existing methodologies offer sensor-based IoT based health-care services, to the end-users populated with lots of sensed values all at a time, making the health-care system with least robustness and inefficient due to unsystematic preview of patient’s health record. In order to address this issue, a novel semantic-based service framework is proposed in this paper which allows the end-user to subscribe for a specific physiological parameter, among all the available sensed data, making the health-care system more efficient. In the SeSem framework, Semantification rules and semantification relationship table are applied to the sensed JavaScript object notation format (JSON) data, in order to semantically separate the JSON data, into a meaningful format. To list the sensed data according to the significance of health issues, a priority is assigned to the sensors in the semantification relationship table. Hence, semantically separated data can be done along with assigned priority. Sensor-based sematic ontology is then applied to the semantically separated data, to transform the sensed data more relevant in terms of particular disease and sensor associated with it. The semantically separated sensed data are then published to the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) interface. Using MQTT subscribe, the end-user along with date and time, requests for a particular service, using a Semantic Similarity mapping algorithm, which compares the entire sensed data to that of requested data and responds with a particular physiological parameter request. To make the health care system deploy services in an intelligent way, deep learning algorithm Feedforward Recurrent Neural Networks are applied, which makes the prediction of sensed data based on the latest update when the end-user subscribes for a certain sensed data without specifying date and time. The proposed methodology is evaluated against IoT performance metrics which had shoed showing better results in terms of service-oriented IoT. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Internet of Things; MQTT; Ontology; Semantification rules; Sensor priority; SeSem framework","Conformal mapping; Feedforward neural networks; Health care; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Physiological models; Physiology; Recurrent neural networks; Semantics; Separation; Health-care system; Healthcare services; Learning techniques; Performance metrics; Physiological parameters; Relationship tables; Semantic similarity; Terms of services; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113896453

One of the most vital issues in WSN design is power usage, as it is nearly impossible to recharge or replace sensor nodes’ batteries. A prominent role in conserving power for energy-constrained networks is served by the clustering algorithm. It is possible to reduce network energy usage and network lifespan prolongation by proper balancing of the network load with Cluster Head (CH) election. The single-hop inter-cluster routing technique, in which there is a direct transfer from CHs to the base station, is done by the low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy. However, for networks with large-regions, this technique is not viable. An optimized Orphan-LEACH (O-LEACH) has been proposed in this work to facilitate the formation of a novel process of clustering, which can result in minimized usage of energy as well as enhanced network longevity. Sufficient energy is possessed by the orphan node, which will attempt to cover the network. The proposed work’s primary novel contribution is the O-LEACH protocol that supplies the entire network’s coverage with the least number of orphaned nodes and has extremely high connectivity rates. A hybrid optimization utilizing simulated annealing with Lightning Search Algorithm (LSA) (SA-LSA), and particle swarm optimization with LSA (PSO-LSA) Algorithm is proposed. These proposed techniques effectively manage the CH election achieving optimal path routing and minimization in energy usage, resulting in the enhanced lifespan of the WSN. The proposed technique’s superior performance, when compared with other techniques, is confirmed from the outcomes of the experimentations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Clustering; Internet of things; Lightning search algorithm and particle swarm optimization; Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy protocol; Orphan-LEACH; Simulated annealing; Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Energy storage; Internet of things; Leaching; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power management (telecommunication); Sensor nodes; Simulated annealing; Storage as a service (STaaS); Cluster-based routing; Energy-constrained networks; High connectivity; Hybrid optimization; Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization; Inter-cluster routing; Low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchies; Search Algorithms; Clustering algorithms",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113328301

However, these credentials are significantly larger than the MTU and are, therefore, sent in a large number of fragments. As IoT devices are resource constrained and battery powered, there are considerable computations and communication overheads for fragment processing both on the sender and receiver devices, which limit their ability to serve real-time requests. Moreover, the fragment processing operations increase energy consumption by CPUs and radio transceivers, which results in shorter battery life. In this article, we propose CATComp—a compression-aware authorization protocol for constrained application protocol (CoAP) and datagram transport layer security (DTLS) that enables IoT devices to exchange small-sized certificates and capability tokens over the IEEE 802.15.4 media. CATComp introduces additional messages in the CoAP and DTLS handshakes that allow communicating devices to negotiate a compression method, which devices use to reduce the credentials' sizes before sending them over an IEEE 802.15.4 link. The decrease in the size of the security materials minimizes the total number of packet fragments, communication overheads for fragment delivery, fragment processing delays, and energy consumption. As such, devices can respond to requests faster and have longer battery life. We implement a prototype of CATComp on Contiki-enabled RE-Mote IoT devices and provide a performance analysis of CATComp. The experimental results show that communication latency and energy consumption are reduced when CATComp is integrated with CoAP and DTLS. © 2021 IEEE.","Authentication; Authorization; Internet of Things; Payloads; Protocols; Receivers; Security","Electric batteries; Energy utilization; IEEE Standards; Physical layer; Program processors; Radio transceivers; Radio transmission; Communication latency; Communication overheads; Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP); Internet of thing (IOT); Maximum transmission units; Performance analysis; Processing operations; Transport layer security; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113238207

The dynamic nature of fog layer resources depends on the users’ requirements for resources. Due to limited resources available at the fog layer, a resource utilization policy is required to ensure efficient resource usability. Therefore, it is significant to allocate the resources and scheduling tasks on the fog layer. In this paper, a soft real-time based resource utilization framework has been proposed.

Inference using such complex networks is fairly resource intensive, prohibiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this context, we make two observations: First, the ability to classify an exhaustive list of categories is excessive for the demands of most IoT applications. Furthermore, designing a new custom-designed CNN for each new IoT application is inefficient. The observations motivate us to consider if one can utilize an existing optimized CNN model to automatically construct a competitive CNN for a given IoT application whose objects of interest are a fraction of categories that the original CNN was designed to classify, such that the model's inference resource requirement is proportionally scaled down. We use the term resource scalability to refer to this concept, and develop a methodology for automated synthesis of resource scalable CNNs from an optimized baseline CNN. The synthesized CNN has sufficient learning capacity for handling the given IoT application requirements, and yields competitive accuracy. The proposed approach is fast, and unlike the presently common practice of neural network design, does not require iterative rounds of training trial and error to find an optimal architecture.

NDN introduces new name-based routing, receiver-based service, caching, and self-certifying contents features that obviously improve data delivery efficiency and reliability. Moreover, NDN offers lightweight forwarding rules that suits constrained devices. These features makes NDN as highly promising communication model for the Internet of Things (IoT). On the other hand, one of the widely adopted networking specification for IoT is the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. This latter proposes interesting energy saving functionalities. To take full advantages of the two technologies, we propose an NDN over IEEE 802.15.4 communication solution that meets the requirements of low-data rate and low-power-consumption monitor and control IoT applications. The proposed solution includes two modules: a reliable energy-aware forwarding strategy that selects the next hop forwarder based on its residual energy level and a sleep mode scheduling algorithm that schedules the sleep/wake-up mode according to the role of the node in the forwarding and the path repair processes.

It is bound to bring about the occurrence of node nonuniform distribution over time. Given the obstacles and boundaries constrained areas, the intention of this article is to redeploy the drifted underwater nodes for regaining higher coverage rate. Hence, we propose a 3-D virtual force coverage algorithm (3D-VFCA). Inspired by the physical water flow action, the position evolution model of drifted underwater nodes is derived under the continuous gravity, buoyancy, propulsion, and resistance forces, which can reveal the mechanism of UWSNs deformation and coverage holes caused by the underwater node drift. Then, the coverage problem of dense and sparse node distributions is transformed into the optimization problem of weighted distance between node positions and clustering centers in the precoverage process, which can reduce large moving distances caused by node blind movements and solve the problem of inaccurate clustering centers caused by outliers. Furthermore, the improved virtual force algorithm is designed in consideration of underwater nodes, obstacles, and boundaries, which can drive the precovered underwater nodes to more optimal positions based on the adaptive moving distance per step. Finally, coverage performance evaluations of drifted underwater nodes are performed under different coverage algorithms, node numbers, and obstacles. The experimental results indicate that the proposed 3D-VFCA can improve the coverage rates in UWSNs. © 2021 IEEE.","Clustering algorithms; Force; Heuristic algorithms; Internet of Things; Machine learning algorithms; Optimization; Solid modeling","Flow of water; Hydraulics; Marine communication; Clustering centers; Coverage algorithms; Coverage optimizations; Evolution modeling; Non-uniform distribution; Optimization problems; Topological structure; Underwater wireless sensor networks; Sensor nodes",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112634622

However, the sensors involved in such systems are rarely adopted in residential houses due to their relatively high costs and users' privacy concerns. Low-cost and nonintrusive IoT sensors have been proposed for residential houses for use with machine-learning algorithms. Furthermore, such sensors may be triggered very infrequently due to their nonintrusive nature, and it can take several days/weeks to collect sufficient training data. There is a research gap in accurately detecting occupancy information in residential houses with limited training data. This article proposes a trust-based occupancy detection scheme, which achieves high detection accuracy based on limited training data collected by nonintrusive, low-cost sensors. First, rather than directly taking raw sensor data as inputs, the semantic meanings (i.e., human activity sequences) are extracted from the data based on the order of triggered sensors. Second, the extracted human activity sequences are fed into the proposed trust-based sequence matching scheme for further occupancy detection. Comprehensive experimental results show that, when compared to existing occupancy detection algorithms, the proposed scheme can reliably achieve higher accuracy, especially when only limited training data is available. © 2021 IEEE.","Buildings; Machine learning algorithms; Sensor systems; Sensors; Temperature measurement; Temperature sensors; Training data","Costs; Energy efficiency; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Houses; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Office buildings; Privacy by design; Semantics; Building energy consumption; Commercial building; Detection accuracy; Internet of Things (IOT); Limited training data; Occupancy detections; Residential house; Sequence matching; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112444889

Inspired by the great success of deep learning in pattern recognition, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are introduced into the AMC. In general, there are two popular data formats used by AMC, which are the in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) representation and amplitude/phase (A/P) representation, respectively. However, most of AMC algorithms aim at structure innovations, while the differences and characteristics of I/Q and A/P are ignored to analyze. In this article, lots of popular AMC algorithms are reproduced and evaluated on the same data set, where the I/Q and A/P are used, respectively, for comparison. Based on the experimental results, it is found that: 1) CNN-RNN-like algorithms using A/P as input data are superior to those using I/Q at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while it has an opposite result in low SNR and 2) the features extracted from I/Q and A/P are complementary to each other. Motivated by the aforementioned findings, a multitask learning-based deep neural network (MLDNN) is proposed, which effectively fuses I/Q and A/P. In addition, the MLDNN also has a novel backbone, which is made up of three blocks to extract discriminative features, and they are CNN block, bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) block, and a step attention fusion network (SAFN) block. Different from most of CNN-RNN-like algorithms (i.e., they only use the last step outputs of RNN), all step outputs of BiGRU can be effectively utilized by MLDNN with the help of SAFN.

Such sophisticated autonomous functionality must be achieved while dealing with severe constraints in payload, battery, and power budget (100mW). In this work, we attack a complex task going from perception to control: to estimate and maintain the nano-UAV's relative 3-D pose with respect to a person while they freely move in the environment—a task that, to the best of our knowledge, has never previously been targeted with fully onboard computation on a nano-sized UAV. Our approach is centered around a novel vision-based deep neural network (DNN), called Frontnet, designed for deployment on top of a parallel ultra-low power (PULP) processor aboard a nano-UAV. We present a vertically integrated approach starting from the DNN model design, training, and dataset augmentation down to 8-bit quantization and deployment in-field. PULP-Frontnet can operate in real-time (up to 135 frame/s), consuming less than 87 mW for processing at peak throughput and down to 0.43 mJ/frame in the most energy-efficient operating point. Field experiments demonstrate a closed-loop top-notch autonomous navigation capability, with a tiny 27-g Crazyflie 2.1 nano-UAV.

The IoT application demands contributed to the data integration and semantic interoperability need while maintaining high usability and low processing system resources usage. Existing approaches dealt with semantic interoperability by using/extending ontologies with strict schemata/semantics and difficult to be updated. Other approaches tackled high usability by providing sensor data abstractions that infer high-level knowledge, but they are either complex for real-time processing or have semantic/syntactic coupling making them nonflexible. Therefore, our key question is: can a dynamic entity summarization system that provides high-level abstractions while ensuring semantic/syntactic decoupling, and low use of processing system resources, be defined? In this article, we address this question by proposing the abstractive publish/subscribe summarization system that provides abstractive summaries of numerical IoT data for user-friendly subscriptions by using IoTSAX, an enhanced symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) methodology for dynamic IoT environments, and approximate rule-based reasoning by using embedding models. Our results for two use cases, medicine and smart cities, show that although abstraction can be 2 to 3 times slower in latency, it achieves up to 98% reduction in the notifications' number. IoTSAX outperforms SAX in approximation error up to 2 to 3 times more and in compression space-saving percentage when data redundancy occurs, while it has a similar or better latency and throughput performance. Finally, concept hierarchy-based embedding models can achieve F-scores of up to 0.87 for approximate rule-based reasoning. © 2022 IEEE.","Cognition; Internet of Things; Interoperability; Ontologies; Semantics; Sensor systems; Sensors","Data integration; Embeddings; Interoperability; Knowledge based systems; Message passing; Semantics; Approximation errors; Approximation methodology; High-level abstraction; Internet of Things (IOT); Publish/Subscribe system; Semantic interoperability; Sensor data abstraction; Throughput performance; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112242339

The reason lies on eigenvalue of the gradient of loss function against the recurrent weight matrix in recurrent weight matrix. To control the eigenvalues, the orthogonal constraint is imposed on the recurrent weight matrix. In this article, we analyze the designing mechanism of decomposition methods of three orthogonal constrained RNNs (OCRNNs) and derive their corresponding training algorithms. We compare the performance of the four OCRNNs and the standard long short-term memory (LSTM) network on the synthetic baseline copying and adding tasks. We find out that the coordinate descent-based iteration of the two OCRNNs proposed by us can achieve comparative or better testing error and convergence speed than the rest model. The above two OCRNN models are more cost-effective in terms of total number of parameters, which save the storage of the model. Furthermore, we introduce the pseudospectrum to visualize and monitor the evolving of the orthogonality of the recurrent weight matrix and find that the orthogonality is a empirically useful condition but not rigorously theoretical guarantee for convergence speed. Finally, we deploy the three OCRNNs on the acoustic polyp detection problem based on the and formulate the detection problem as the sequential binary classification.

In the current solutions, some use blockchain technology to solve data security problems while some use federated learning technology to solve privacy problems, but these methods neither combine with the special environment of the ocean nor consider the security of task publishers. In this article, we propose a secure sharing method of MIoT data under an edge computing framework based on federated learning and blockchain technology. Combining its special distributed architecture with the MIoT edge computing architecture, federated learning ensures the privacy of nodes. The blockchain serves as a decentralized way, which stores federated learning workers to achieve nontampering and security. We propose a concept of quality and reputation as the metrics of selection for federated learning workers. Meanwhile, we design a quality proof mechanism [proof of quality (PoQ)] and apply it to the blockchain, making the edge nodes recorded in the blockchain more high-quality.

Thus, we propose a hidden Markov model that aggregates the actions measured with a single Doppler sensor (based on the likelihood) in each fall and nonfall events. To validate the proposed method, we conducted an experiment with 20 subjects who performed three fall actions and four nonfall actions each.

The characteristics of interest from the input signals are first isolated in the wavelet domain and then combined to form a fused feature signal using a weighted average. The weights used are derived from a signal quality index calculation algorithm, suitable for periodic/quasiperiodic signals of different wave morphologies. The peak detection process to identify the heartbeat locations is carried out on the final fused signal. The research evaluates the algorithm performance when different types of noises at varying amplitudes corrupt the ECG and PPG signal inputs, affecting the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The algorithm consistently exhibited a sensitivity of 99.69%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 99.64%, mean beat-to-beat interval relative error of 0.01, and an error spread (corresponding to 90th percentile of relative errors) of 0.02 in the −30 to 50 dB SNR range for all noise scenarios considered.

The ITMS consists of three main layers, which are: Internet of Things (IoT), edge, and cloud layers. Edge can collect real-time data from different routes through IoT devices such as wireless sensors, and then it can compute and store this collected data before transmitting them to the cloud for further processing. Thus, an edge is an intermediate layer between IoT and cloud layers that can receive the transmitted data through IoT to overcome cloud challenges such as high latency. In this paper, a novel real-time traffic congestion prediction strategy (TCPS) is proposed based on the collected data in the edge’s cache server at the edge layer. The proposed TCPS contains three stages, which are: (i) real-time congestion prediction (RCP) stage, (ii) congestion direction detection (CD2) stage, and (iii) width change decision (WCD) stage. The RCP aims to predict traffic congestion based on the causes of congestion in the hotspot using a fuzzy inference system. If there is congestion, the CD2 stage is used to detect the congestion direction based on the predictions from the RCP by using the Optimal Weighted Naïve Bayes (OWNB) method. The WCD stage aims to prevent the congestion occurrence in which it is used to change the width of changeable routes (CR) after detecting the direction of congestion in CD2. The experimental results have shown that the proposed TCPS outperforms other recent methodologies. TCPS provides the highest accuracy, precision, and recall. Besides, it provides the lowest error, with values equal to 95%, 74%, 75%, and 5% respectively. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Congestion prediction; Data mining; Edge computing; IoT; Traffic management","Edge computing; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Internet of things; Real time systems; Congestion prediction; Direction detections; Fuzzy inference systems; Intelligent traffic management; Intermediate layers; Internet of Things (IOT); Traditional systems; Wireless sensor; Traffic congestion",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112176707

Currently, most of the existing research do not jointly consider designs, including the mainlobe interference (MI) avoidance and resource blocks (RBs) fairness allocation. In this article, a novel fairness allocation strategy is proposed to achieve the minimum MI and a fair RB assignment for mmWave networks. To achieve the minimum MI, an MI mitigation (MIM) algorithm is designed to maximize the data rate for each UE. With the adaptive mini-timeslot design, the MIM algorithm can achieve MI cancelation for all UEs at each identical timeslot and beam. To combine MIM and fairness for RB allocation among all UEs, the MIM-fairness allocation (MIM-FA) algorithm is also presented. Based on a novel mini-timeslot with designed multiple frames, the MIM-FA algorithm can simultaneously guarantee the fairness among all UEs and mitigate MI at each mini-timeslot for each beam. Additionally, the MIM-FA algorithm can be verified that it achieves the maximum user data rate with the identical number of RBs under the lowest number of frames. Simulation results validate that the proposed MIM and MIM-FA algorithms can provide a higher data rate and better fairness for different scenarios compared to current state-of-the-art competitive approaches. © 2021 IEEE.","Array signal processing; Interference; Internet of Things; Precoding; Quality of service; Resource management; Throughput","Beamforming; Millimeter waves; Allocation strategy; Data rates; Interference management; Millimeter waves (mmwave); Multibeams; Multiple-frame; State of the art; User equipments; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112175312

Although a number of approaches have been proposed, their essential drawbacks limit the effect of visual privacy protection in real applications. In this article, we propose a cycle vector-quantized variational autoencoder (cycle-VQ-VAE) framework to encode and decode the video with its extracted audio, which takes the advantage of multiple heterogeneous data sources in the video itself to protect individuals' privacy. In our cycle-VQ-VAE framework, a fusion mechanism is designed to integrate the video and its extracted audio. Particularly, the extracted audio works as the random noise with a nonpatterned distribution, which outperforms the noise that follows a patterned distribution for hiding visual information in the video. Under this framework, we design two models, including the frame-to-frame (F2F) model and video-to-video (V2V) model, to obtain privacy-preserving video streaming. In F2F, the video is processed as a sequence of frames; while, in V2V, the relations between frames are utilized to deal with the video, greatly improving the performance of privacy protection, video compression, and video reconstruction. Moreover, the video streaming is compressed in our encoding process, which can resist side-channel inference attack during video transmission and reduce video transmission time. Through the real-data experiments, we validate the superiority of our models (F2F and V2V) over the existing methods in visual privacy protection, visual quality preservation, and video transmission efficiency.

IoT networks enable smart devices to compile environmental information and transmit it to demanding users through an IoT gateway. The explosive increase of IoT users and sensors causes network bottlenecks, leading to significant energy depletion in IoT devices. The wireless network is a robust, empirically significant, and IoT layer based on progressive characteristics. The development of energy-efficient routing protocols for learning purposes is critical due to environmental volatility, unpredictability, and randomness in the wireless network’s weight distribution. To achieve this critical need, learning-based routing systems are emerging as potential candidates due to their high degree of flexibility and accuracy. However, routing becomes more challenging in dynamic IoT networks due to the time-varying characteristics of link connections and access status. Hence, modern learning-based routing systems must be capable of adapting in real-time to network changes. This research presents an intelligent fault detection, energy-efficient, quality-of-service routing technique based on reinforcement learning to find the optimum route with the least amount of end-to-end latency. However, the cluster head selection is dependent on residual energy from the cluster nodes that reduce the entire network’s existence. Consequently, it extends the network’s lifetime, overcomes the data transmission’s energy usage, and improves network robustness. The experimental results indicate that network efficiency has been successfully enhanced by fault-tolerance strategies that include highly trusted computing capabilities, thus decreasing the risk of network failure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cluster head; Energy efficient; Fault tolerant; Internet of things; Reinforcement learning; Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency; Fault detection; Fault tolerance; Gateways (computer networks); Learning systems; Network routing; Power management (telecommunication); Quality of service; Real time systems; Reinforcement learning; Wireless sensor networks; Cluster-head selections; Degree of flexibility; End to end latencies; Energy efficient routing protocol; Environmental information; Internet of thing (IOT); Quality of Service routing; Time-varying characteristics; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111868809

At the same time, the concept of dew computing modifies the current mechanism of cloud-based services for IoT. It minimizes the response time of comprehensive data, which was collected by nearby resources. However, speedy advancement in IoT directs the evolving security aspects to address emerging challenges. To address the security issues, a mutual authentication architecture has been introduced for dew computing, which ensures secure and authorized session establishment without the requirement of a trusted server.

The considered problem is formulated to jointly minimize the average interference and ensure the collision avoidance among UAVs. By exploiting the problem characteristics, our major contributions are summarized as follows. First, the singular case tolerance (SCT)-artificial potential field (APF) is proposed to overcome the failure of traditional APFs in collision avoidance, where the repulsive force gain coefficient among UAVs is dynamically controlled by the corresponding interferences. Second, the mean-field game (MFG) model is established to control communication power, where the instantaneous interferences among flying UAVs are represented by the mean-field approximation. Third, considering the tight coupling of trajectory and interference of UAVs, a cooperative control approach enabled by dual-fields is proposed to jointly adjust the trajectories and power of UAVs. Simulation results validate the significant performance improvement of the cooperative control approach enabled by dual-fields. Compared with separate APF and MFG, the proposed dual-field-cooperation approach can achieve about 117% throughput gain and 88% interference reduction when the UAV swarm is close to the target. © 2021 IEEE.","Interference; Internet of Things; Mathematical model; Power control; Target tracking; Trajectory; Unmanned aerial vehicles","Antennas; Collision avoidance; Artificial potential fields; Co-operative control; Control communications; Interference mitigation; Interference reduction; Mean field approximation; Repulsive forces; Transmission power; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110836771

The health conditions of the patients fluctuate over time. Further, specialized medical care may not always be available in all healthcare facilities. The use of wireless body area network (WBAN) for continuous patient monitoring addresses the issue to a certain extent. However, as the physiological parameters of a patient are time-critical in nature, any delay, packet loss, and network overhead, may result in deterioration of the patient's health conditions. Considering this, we design a Software-defined fog-enabled IoT platform for various healthcare applications. We consider that the fog layer comprises SDN switches that allocate the packet to the appropriate fog/cloud depending upon the criticality index (CI) of the data packets originating from patients. We mathematically formulate the CI, based on the physiological parameters sensed and transmitted to the switches. Further, we design an optimization function to obtain the maximum utility of a fog node, for an optimal number of processes executed by that node. We apply the Lagrangian method to simplify the optimization function and solve it using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions. We apply the auto-regression model to predict the total delay incurred and the total energy consumed by the proposed scheme. Exhaustive analysis of our proposed scheme, Soft-Health, demonstrates that the delay incurred decreases by 24.57% and 40.1% approximately, compared to the existing schemes, Mobi-Flow, and CARE, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.","Biomedical monitoring; Body area networks; Cloud computing; Delays; Internet of Things; Medical services; Wireless communication","Application programs; Deterioration; Fog; Fog computing; Health care; Lagrange multipliers; Network architecture; Packet networks; Patient monitoring; Physiological models; Physiology; Regression analysis; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Autoregression models; Health care application; Healthcare facility; Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition; Lagrangian methods; Optimization function; Physiological parameters; Wireless body area network; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110804313

Although distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) could provide such a platform, blockchains, such as Bitcoin, were not designed with IoT networks in mind, hence are often unsuitable for such applications: they offer poor transaction throughput and confirmation times, put stress on constrained computing and storage resources, and require high transaction fees. In this article, we consider a class of IoT-friendly DLTs based on directed acyclic graphs, rather than a blockchain, and with a reputation system in the place of Proof of Work (PoW). However, without PoW, the implementation of these DLTs requires an access control algorithm to manage the rate at which nodes can add new transactions to the ledger. We model the access control problem and present an algorithm that is fair, efficient, and secure. Our algorithm represents a new design paradigm for DLTs in which concepts from networking are applied to the DLT setting for the first time. For example, our algorithm uses distributed rate setting, which is similar in nature to transmission control used in the Internet. However, our solution features novel adaptations to cope with the adversarial environment of DLTs in which no individual agent can be trusted. Our algorithm guarantees utilization of resources, consistency, fairness, and resilience against attackers. All of these are achieved efficiently and with regard for the limitations of IoT devices. We perform extensive simulations to validate these claims. © 2021 IEEE.","Access control; Blockchain; Distributed ledger; Internet of Things; Peer-to-peer computing; Quality of service; Throughput","Access control; Blockchain; Directed graphs; Trusted computing; Adversarial environments; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Extensive simulations; Internet of thing (IOT); Reputation systems; Storage resources; Transaction throughput; Transmission control; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110792194

Other than the listed CVDs, the abnormality in the cardiac rhythm caused by the long term mental stress (stimulated by Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)) is a challenging issue for researchers. Early detection of cardiac arrhythmias through automatic electronic techniques is an important research field since the invention of electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) and advanced machine learning algorithms. ECG (EKG) provides the record of variations in electrical activity associated with the cardiac cycle, used by cardiologists and researchers as a gold standard to study the heart function. The present work is aimed to provide an extensive survey of work done by researchers in the area of automated ECG analysis and classification of regular & irregular classes of heartbeats by conventional and modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The artificial intelligence (AI) based methods have emerged popularly during the last decade for the automatic and early diagnosis of clinical symptoms of arrhythmias. In this work, the literature is explored for the last two decades to review the performance of AI and other computer-based techniques to analyze the ECG signals for the prediction of cardiac (heart rhythm) disorders. The existing ECG feature extraction techniques and machine learning (ML) methods used for ECG signal analysis and classification are compared using the performance metrics like specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, positive predictivity value, etc. Some popular AI methods, which include, artificial neural networks (ANN), Fuzzy logic systems, and other machine learning algorithms (support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), etc.) are considered in this review work for the applications of cardiac arrhythmia classification. The popular ECG databases available publicly to evaluate the classification accuracy of the classifier are also mentioned.

As a strategy to alleviate the escalation of resource congestion, collaborative edge computing (CEC) has become a new paradigm for solving the needs of the Internet of Things (IoT). CEC can provide computing, storage, and network connection resources for remote devices. Because the edge network is closer to the connected devices, it involves a large amount of users' privacy. This also makes edge networks face more and more security issues, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, unauthorized access, packet sniffing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To combat these issues and enhance the security of edge networks, we propose a deep learning-based intrusion detection algorithm. Based on the generative adversarial network (GAN), we designed a powerful intrusion detection method. Our intrusion detection method includes three phases. First, we use the feature selection module to process the collaborative edge network traffic. Second, a deep learning architecture based on GAN is designed for intrusion detection aiming at a single attack. Finally, we propose a new intrusion detection model by combining several intrusion detection models that aim at a single attack. Intrusion detection aiming at multiple attacks is realized through the designed GAN-based deep learning architecture. Besides, we provide a comprehensive evaluation to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2014 IEEE.","Collaborative edge computing (CEC); generative adversarial network (GAN); intrusion detection; social internet of things (SIoT)","Deep learning; Denial-of-service attack; Edge computing; Internet of things; Network architecture; Network security; Privacy by design; Adversarial networks; Comprehensive evaluation; Internet of thing (IOT); Intrusion detection algorithms; Intrusion detection method; Intrusion detection models; Learning architectures; Man in the middle attacks; Intrusion detection",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103251401

SIoT also integrates the concepts of social networking and IoT into collaborative edge computing (CEC), the so-called CEC-based SIoT architecture. In closer proximity, IoT devices self-organize into a CEC-based SIoT computing cluster and provide social device-to-device (S-D2D) services, such as computation offloading, service discovery, and content delivery. In the CEC-based SIoT, however, cooperation based on social connections leads to a problem called social and spatial physical trade-off. This problem is also referred to as the mismatch problem, which arises because the spatial neighbors in the social layer cannot always be related. The spatial distance thus calls for additional multi-hop transmissions. This work presents a novel solution called 3-D-social identifier structure (3-D-SIS) model. The 3-D-SIS model is based on 3-D social space (3-D-SS) and considers social ties and physical connections (i.e., intra-neighbor) of the SIoT devices and utilizes a 3-D structure to evaluate that relationship. Moreover, it minimizes the end-to-end delay and communication cost to address the mismatch problem. To validate the performance of the (3-D-SIS) model, we use the real traces of social networks (INFOCOM06). The results show that the 3-D-SIS selects the best neighbor in S-D2D communication and improves performance in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput. © 2014 IEEE.","Collaborative edge computing (CEC); social device-to-device (social D2D) communication; social Internet of Things (IoT) (SIoT)","Cluster computing; Economic and social effects; Edge computing; Network architecture; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Communication cost; Computation offloading; Computing clusters; Cooperation based; D2D communications; Internet of Things (IOT); Multihop transmission; Physical connections; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103251034

The current widely used global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) cannot meet the precision requirements of the submeter level. Due to the development of sensing techniques and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, some vehicles can interact with surrounding landmarks to achieve precise positioning. Existing work aims to realize the positioning correction of common vehicles by sharing the positioning data of sensor-rich vehicles. However, the privacy of trajectory data makes it difficult to collect and train data centrally. Moreover, uploading vehicle location data wastes network resources. To fill these gaps, this article proposes a vehicle cooperative positioning (CP) system based on federated learning (FedVCP), which makes full use of the potential of social Internet of Things (IoT) and collaborative edge computing (CEC) to provide high-precision positioning correction while ensuring user privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first attempt to solve the privacy of CP from a perspective of federated learning. In addition, we take the advantages of local cooperation through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in data augmentation. For individual differences in vehicle positioning, we utilize transfer learning to eliminate the impact of such differences.

Edge computing delivers real-time computations and communications for IoT devices by leveraging edge servers deployed close to users, which creates a collaborative edge computing (CEC) paradigm. The capacity of edge servers is beneficial but risky, as vulnerable servers can be exploited to conduct surveillance or perform other nefarious activities. Besides, fake IoT devices would bring security threats and compromise the IoT system. This highlights the necessity of designing a secure and efficient mutual authentication scheme for CEC. In this direction, related works have proposed various authentication mechanisms, but most of them are found unfit due to the absence of decentralization, anonymity, and mobility. Motivated by this fact, we propose a blockchain-based mutual authentication scheme that bridges these gaps. Specifically, blockchain, certificateless cryptography, elliptic curve cryptography, and pseudonym-based cryptography are integrated into our scheme to provide mutual authentication between edge servers and IoT devices. Except for static conditions, both intraedge and interedge authentication are considered. Besides, we elaborate on the key generation procedures and design a session key negotiation mechanism.

As millions of devices are connected over the internet, security becomes a more challenging issue in the Cloud-IoT environment. Many research works have contributed to ensuring security in Cloud-IoT. But none of the works has proven its security strength and efficiency. In particular, centralized authentication and complex encryption schemes increase the overhead even for low-level security. This paper proposes a novel Decentralized Blockchain-based Security (DeBlock-Sec) scheme, which is most suitable for resource-constrained IoT environment to abridge the security issue. The overall system works upon three significant phases, (1) authentication phase, (2) data encryption phase, and (3) data retrieval phase. For authentication, we propose a novel Decentralized Blockchain-based Authentication (DBA) protocol. The DBA protocol uses multiple factors to authenticate users and devices. In the next phase, data encryption is carried on the IoT devices. As the amount of data to be encrypted is large in size, the encryption is performed in the spark environment since the confidentiality of data is vital. The data retrieval phase allows users to access the data stored in the Cloud. Dendrimer Fractal Tree Indexing is followed to minimize the searching time and the Revised Diffie-Hellman algorithm is presented for key exchange. The extensive experiments performed in Spark environment show that the proposed work achieves better performance in terms of time consumption (encryption, decryption and search), storage space, and throughput.

However, for IoT applications, it is not feasible to send voluminous raw data to the cloud or a remote backend server on account of high latency, information security concerns or lack of network coverage.

One constraint that is taken into consideration in terms of budget is that, a task provider is not having an entire budget available a priori, but only a part of the overall budget is available at the time of floating of the tasks. It means that, the overall budget comes incrementally in multiple phases. On the other hand, each IoT device reports valuation—the costs it charges for executing the tasks. The valuations of each of the IoT devices are private (only known to it and not known to others).

Group discovery, as a prerequisite step of group recommendation that can be used to assist groups of users to select services in IoT-enriched environments, has an important impact on recommendation performance. However, existing group recommendation solutions assume that a user belongs to a specific group and ignore the possible correlation between the user's preferences and other groups' preferences. In addition, existing solutions treat group members as equal individuals and assign them equal weights, which makes it hard to meet the user's accurate recommendation requirements. Furthermore, these methods focus on group members' explicit preference information while ignoring implicit preferences. To address these problems, we propose a group discovery method based on collaborative filtering and knowledge graph (GD-CFKG). This method first uses the attention mechanism to learn the embedding of service entities from knowledge graphs and interaction between users and services to achieve users' own preferences embedding. Considering that the preferences of similar users will help to attain accurate target user's preferences, we then train users' final preferences embedding by collaborative filtering and word2vec method. We conduct experiments to evaluate our approach using the MovieLens and Douban data sets.

The real-time requirement of these mobile data has been accommodated well by fog computing in the past few years, mainly through offloading tasks to fog nodes in the vicinity. On the other hand, the user-privacy hidden in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) data has not been sufficiently considered in the presence of insecure fog nodes. It is risky to offload an entire mission-critical task to just one fog node or several fog nodes owned by the same service provider (SP), especially when the SP is marked with low-security credit and tends to collect data information of users for malicious use. To address this issue, we classify IoT user tasks based on their security requirements, divide them into different numbers of smaller fragments, and, finally, offload the segments of a task to multiple fog nodes owned by the same or various SPs according to their security requirements. The selected fog nodes will collaboratively serve the divided fragments to avoid the possible damage caused by the leak of sensitive data due to compromised fog nodes of malicious SPs.

The key RF-Mehndi novelty is that when the user's fingertip touching on the tag array surface during the communication, the backscattered signals by the tag array become user-dependent and unique. Hence, if we enhance the communication modality of many personal cards nowadays by RF-Mehndi, in case that a card gets lost or stolen, it cannot be used illegally by the adversaries. To harvest such a benefit, we leverage two key observations in designing RF-Mehndi. The first one is when tags are nearby, their interrogated currents can change each other's circuit characteristics, based on which unique phase features can be obtained from backscattered signals. The second observation is that when the user's fingertip touches the tag array surface during communication, the phase feature can be further profiled by this user. Based on these observations, the card and its holder can be potentially authenticated at the same time. To transfer the RF-Mehndi idea to a practical system, we further address technical challenges. We implement a prototype system. Extensive evaluations show the effectiveness of RF-Mehndi, achieving excellent authentication performance. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","device authentication; internet of things; mobile security; RFID","Computer networks; Mobile computing; Backscattered signal; Communication modalities; Phase features; Practical systems; Prototype system; RF-ID tags; Technical challenges; User-dependent; Electromagnetic wave backscattering",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099552820

A hardware-oriented lightweight authentication protocol based on device signature generated during voltage over-scaling (VOS) was recently proposed to address this issue. VOS-based authentication employs the computation unit such as adders to generate the process variation dependent error, which is combined with secret keys to create a two-factor authentication protocol. In this article, machine learning (ML)-based modeling attacks to break such authentication is presented. We also propose a challenge self-obfuscation structure (CSoS) which employs previous challenges combined with keys or random numbers to obfuscate the current challenge for the VOS-based authentication to resist ML attacks.

Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is widely used to solve city transportation problems by employing multihop-based V2V communication. In IoT-based vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), devices are interconnected with various hardware and software, so the privacy of data, temporal, and location will be at risk due to unauthorized manipulation, especially at intersections in congested urban areas. To address these concerns in IoT-based VANETs, we proposed a smart energy-based source location privacy preservation (SESLPP) technique for sustainable urban city roads (ie, intersections). The proposed SESLPP protects the source location privacy while maintaining an accurate reputation based on specific parameters such as trust, speed, distance, and acceleration. A selected node based on these parameters forwards messages and acts as a phantom node to improve the source location privacy within their communication range. The selection of a phantom node is based on a set of parameters, which makes it a multicriteria decision problem. In this article, a multicriteria decision tool known as analytical network process has been used for optimal phantom node selection that improves the source location privacy in an urban scenario by considering intersections. We considered the same parameters (trust, speed, distance, and acceleration) that was used for highway scenario with proper adjustment of their values for an urban area (crossroad intersection point).

By motivating the above-mentioned challenges, in this article, we propose a deadline-aware dynamic task placement (DDTP) strategy to offload and place the tasks to a suitable computing device in fog networks.

The proposed DDTP strategy selects the suitable computing device for each incoming task as per the deadline and ensures to meet the deadline constraints of the tasks using a dynamic task allocation policy. Finally, a dispatch-constrained offloading policy is developed to reassign the failed tasks to the available fog nodes in the network.

Nevertheless, due to lack of mobility support in the IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPLs), which is standardized for multihop IoT infrastructures, providing reliable communications in terms of packet delivery ratio (PDR) in mobile IoT applications has become significantly challenging. While several studies tried to enhance the adaptability of RPL to network dynamics, their utilized routing metrics have prevented them from establishing long-lasting reliable paths. Furthermore, the stochastic parent replacement policy in the standard version of RPL has intensified this challenge. Aside from this, due to the existing tradeoff between reliability and power efficiency, most of the existing approaches have only concentrated on one of these concerns without paying attention to the other one. To address these issues, this article introduces ARMOR, a routing mechanism built upon RPL, which employs a novel mobility-aware routing metric, i.e., time to reside (TTR), and a corresponding parent replacement policy. According to the motion characteristics of the mobile objects, TTR provides an estimation of how long the nodes will be in the transmission range of each other. This enables ARMOR to select nodes, which provide longer connection period and consequently higher reliability. In comparison with the state of the art, while keeping the power consumption constant, ARMOR significantly improves the amount of PDR in the network by up to $2.5\times $ , while it enhances the reliability against the original version of this protocol by up to $4.2\times $. © 2014 IEEE.","Embedded devices; Internet of Things (IoT); mobility; neighbor table replacement; power efficiency; reliability; routing; routing protocol for low-power and lossy network (RPL)","Armor; Efficiency; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Low power electronics; Routing protocols; Stochastic systems; Embedded device; Internet of thing; Lossy networks; Low Power Networks; Mobility; Neighbor table replacement; Power-efficiency; Routing protocol for low-power and lossy network (RPL); Routing-protocol; Routings; Reliability",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122804125

On this basis, we designed two cascade failure mechanisms for the global routing mode and the local routing mode, respectively. Through extensive experiments, the soundness of the proposed cascade model has been verified and some meaningful findings have been obtained: compared with global routing mode, the network in local routing mode is more reliable; as the recovery time of overloaded router nodes increases, the fluctuation of the network cascade process tends to be more wildly; deploying more gateways can significantly improve the reliability of the IoT; choosing the high-degree nodes as gateways can better improve network reliability.

Current works generally investigate a variety of features, while most of them suffer from high characteristic design cost, difficult feature selection, and poor real-time performance, etc. More seriously, data imbalance makes models hard to train, resulting in the low detection rate of abnormal samples. In this paper, we propose a multi-level feature fusion model (MFFusion) that combines data timing, byte, and statistical features to extract valid information from multiple perspectives, to obtain a more efficient and robust model. To deal with the problem of data imbalance, we propose the adaptive balance training method (ABT) and design a new loss function called Attention Loss. Experiments show that ABT can stabilize the training process, reduce the training time, and improve the model performance; Attention Loss adjusts the weights of samples adaptively, which improves the detection rate of abnormal samples.

However, issues like efficient trajectory planning, security and privacy protection, task scheduling, a delegation of tasks from one UAV to another in multi-UAV systems, etc., require rigorous research and analysis. In this paper, we consider a multi-UAV multi-IoT network, which is divided into certain hexagonal cells. Each cell consists of some IoT devices and a UAV to process the data those IoT devices collect from the environment. IoT devices in each cell are grouped into clusters so that UAVs hover only above cluster heads and midpoints of cell boundaries to collect and delegate tasks whenever required. Provision of both single and multi-hop task delegation exists in our system. The schedule is formed based on the UAV's next intended arrival time as computed by cluster heads in the cell using the Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model. Timestamps of visiting midpoints of cell boundaries are fitted between predicted next arrival times of visiting cluster heads. Energy consumption and time of transition from one hovering point to another can be optimized. However, the most energy-efficient solution may not necessarily be the most delay efficient. A multi-objective optimization technique is applied to identify the Pareto-optimal front and select the best possible solution.

The challenge of an efficient TA is to assign the tasks to the best devices, according to the context and task requirements. The main purpose of this article is to study the different connotations of the concept of TA efficiency, and the key factors that most impact on it, so that relevant design guidelines can be defined. This article first analyzes the domains of connected devices where TA has an important role, which brings to this classification: 1) Internet of Things (IoT); 2) sensor and actuator networks (SANs); 3) multirobot systems (MRSs); 4) mobile crowdsensing (MCS); and 5) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). This article then demonstrates that the impact of the key factors on the domains actually affects the design choices of the state-of-the-art TA solutions. It results that resource management has most significantly driven the design of TA algorithms in all domains, especially IoT and SAN. The fulfillment of coverage requirements is important for the definition of TA solutions in MCS and UAV. Quality of Information requirements are mostly included in MCS TA strategies, similar to the design of appropriate incentives.

The regular monitoring of IoT network traffic generated from IoT devices is important for their proper functioning and detection of malicious activities. One such crucial activity is the classification of IoT devices in the network traffic. It enables the administrator to monitor the activities of IoT devices which can be useful for proper implementation of Quality of Service, detect malicious IoT devices, etc. In the literature, various methods are proposed for IoT traffic classification using various machine learning algorithms. However, the accuracy of these machine learning algorithms depends on the data generated from various IoT devices, features extracted from network traffic, site at which IoT is deployed, etc. Moreover, the selection of features and machine learning algorithms are manual operations that are prone to error. Therefore, it is important to study the network traffic characteristics as well as suitable machine learning algorithms for accurate and optimized IoT traffic classification. In this article, we perform an in-depth comparative analysis of various popular machine learning algorithms using different effective features extracted from IoT network traffic. We utilize a public data set having 20 days of network traces generated from 20 popular IoT devices. Network traces are first processed to extract the significant features. We then selected state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms based on the recent survey papers for the IoT traffic classification.

In several cases, the Internet of Things (IoT) applications that are time-sensitive require low response time. Thus, reducing the latency in IoT networks is one of the essential tasks. To this end, fog computing is developed with a motive for the data production and consumption to always be within proximity; therefore, the fog nodes must be placed at the edge of the network, which is near the end devices, such that the latency is minimized. The optimal location selection for fog node placement within a network out of a very large number of possibilities, such as minimize latency, is a challenging problem. So, it is a combinatorial optimization problem. Hard combinatorial optimization problems (NP-hard) involve huge discrete search spaces. The fog node placement problem is an NP-hard problem. NP-hard problems are often addressed by using heuristic methods and approximation algorithms. Combinatorial optimization problems can be viewed as searching for the best element of some set of discrete items; therefore in principle, any metaheuristic can be used to solve them. To resolve this, meta-heuristic-based methods is proposed. We apply the Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to design fog node placement algorithms. Genetic Algorithm is observed to give better solutions. Since Genetic Algorithm may get stuck in local optima, Hybrid Genetic Algorithm, and Simulated Annealing (GA-SA), Hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (GA-PSO) were compared with GA. By extensive simulations, it is observed that hybrid GA-SA-based for node placement algorithm outperforms other baseline algorithms in terms of response time for the IoT applications. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company","Fog computing; hybrid meta-heuristic; Internet of Things (IoT); network latency","Approximation algorithms; Combinatorial optimization; Computational complexity; Digital storage; Fog; Fog computing; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Simulated annealing; Web services; Combinatorial optimization problems; End-devices; Genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimizations; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Hybrid metaheuristics; Internet of thing; Metaheuristic; Network latencies; Node placement; Placement algorithm; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116747997

These flexible solar cells are demonstrated to have a bending radius of over 5 cm and exhibit a conversion efficiency of around 25% under air mass 1.5G (1 sun) conditions. Under normal incidence of sunlight at the same conditions, our cell with its small active area of 0.4 cm2 can generate around 10.1 mW of electrical power. This is sufficient to meet the direct current power consumption (∼5.4 mW) requirements of our dust module, which includes a temperature/moisture sensor, a 3-axis linear accelerometer, and a Bluetooth chip. In comparison to a silicon-based flexible solar cell, our demonstrated III-V solar cell is smaller, requiring approximately 40% of the area to produce the same electrical power output. Our dust module is controlled using a self-developed Android application installed on a smartphone and can sustain continuous-wave operation for data collection and wireless transmission even when the incident angle of the sunlight reaches 75°. Pulse-mode operation is still possible even in the case of nearly 90° illuminations (for example, at sunset). Overall, the measurement results for this flexible solar cell are promising, allowing for further reduction in the size of a self-sustaining smart dust module with improved reliability.

Based on these mechanisms, we present four intelligent heater control strategies: 1) outing; 2) occupancy; 3) comfort; and 4) sleep-based control.

To increase the reliability of the evaluation by excluding natural energy fluctuation factors, a treatment group (100 households) and a control group (2281 households) were recruited to measure the energy savings of the treatment group compared to the control group. In a 48-day evaluation, AI-HEMS was found to provide an energy-saving rate of approximately 14% and resident satisfaction of approximately 91%.

In this article, underlaid device-to-device (D2D) transmission powered by radio signals harvested from cellular systems is studied. By considering the dilemmas among EH, D2D transmission opportunity, and interference management, we propose two transmission policies: 1) Policy 1 requires that the available power in the battery should be no less than the D2D transmission power and 2) Policy 2 not only sets the constraint on available power but also introduces the guard zone rule to protect D2D transmissions from severe interference. The employment of a guard zone in this situation is technically challenging since the original distribution of energy arrival will thereby be changed. We derive expressions in closed or semiclosed forms for the considered D2D transmission performance metrics with the stochastic geometry framework and Poisson hole process. With numerical simulation results, the influences of varying network parameters on D2D performances are illustrated. The results show that by introducing a guard zone, the D2D successful transmission rate can be increased by 41.2%.

The majority of the current techniques involve decision makers who determine how and where resources should be distributed. In a standard cloud system, this decision maker is a central server. In an edge system, the decision maker is an edge host. Both approaches have drawbacks. Edge hosts do not always have access to enough global information to create the most optimal resource allocation strategy. Central servers do but at the cost of privacy. A solution is needed that can do both. This article, therefore, presents a novel resource allocation method called concurrent federated reinforcement learning. The scheme inherits the privacy protection of federated learning, the complex problem solving power of reinforcement learning and adds concurrency in the form of joint decision making so the resource allocation strategies work to the benefit of the global system.

The network established by gates has become a medium which connects stations and passengers. However, in addition to directly monitoring the passenger flow, the potential application of the smart card usage data collected by the gates remains an open topic. Although there are several clustering-based works devoted to revealing passengers' travel behavior patterns, research on the social attributes of subway passengers is very limited. To fill the gap, this article proposes a novel method to mine similarity information of passengers by leveraging passengers' communication behaviors hidden in subway card usage data. Passengers are first organized as a graph, which not only reflects the interactions between them but also incorporates the context information of subway stations. Then, the node embedding is used to encode the information contained in the graph and with the use of cosine similarity, the similarity between two passengers is measured. Extensive experiments on two real-world location-based social network data sets and extended experiments on a Shanghai subway data set are conducted. The results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of similarity measurement and provide social features that are distinguishable from travel behavior patterns. © 2014 IEEE.","Node embedding; similarity; smart card; social network; subway; transportation","Behavioral research; Internet of things; Smart cards; Subway stations; Wi-Fi; Communication behavior; Internet of Things (IOT); Location-based social networks; Measuring similarities; Mobile phone applications; Similarity informations; Similarity measurements; Transportation system; Railroads",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112153243

Securing these devices is mainly based on using primitive cryptographic algorithms. The hardware implementation of the cryptographic algorithms should be managed to be suitable for these resource-constrained devices. Finite-field arithmetic operations are at the heart of the cryptographic algorithms, and their efficient implementation directly affects the whole performance of the cryptographic algorithm. Filed multiplication operation is the core of the most finite-field arithmetic operations, such as squaring, inversion, and division. Therefore, this article mainly concentrates on efficiently implementing a resource-constrained unified processor core that simultaneously performs multiplication and squaring operations to reduce hardware resources. The offered processor core has a digit-serial systolic structure providing the designer with flexibility to manage the area, delay, and consumed energy to be suitable for IoT edge devices. ASIC results of the developed design and the reported efficient ones indicate that the proposed structure has a meaningful saving in the area and consumed energy for all embedded word-sizes $v$. The area achieves a reduction varying from 44.7% to 97.46% at $v=8$ , 35.7% to 95.4% at $v=16$ , and 57.1% to 95.6% at $v=32$.

It is necessary to exploit the full capacity of the network and optimize content transfer. Despite the powerful processing and storage capabilities of base stations in 5G technology, edge caching effectively reduces content access time and duplicate traffic, thus optimizing content transfer for more storage resources. The limited memory resources and the dynamic nature of the requested content have necessitated the use of smart caching methods. Sending the required data to central servers can cause additional network overload and learning disabilities due to private data. For this reason, a hierarchical federated deep reinforcement learning (HFDRL) is proposed in this article that uses the FDRL method to predict the user's future requests and to determine the appropriate content replacement strategy. In addition, to perform learning and collaborate caching, the method by which partner devices are determined plays a key role in edge caching performance. HFDRL categorizes edge devices hierarchically, thus avoids the disadvantages of very small or large clusters, takes advantage of both. By minimizing the redundancy of content storage and latency, HFDRL improves the performance for each local base station network individually and the global network. Simulation results of the proposed method show that the hit rate and delay have improved, respectively, by an average of 55% and 67% compared to traditional methods, 40% and 56% compared to the collaborative method, and 14% and 15% compared to one-level FDRL without using hierarchical edge devices clustering. © 2014 IEEE.","Cooperate caching; deep reinforcement learning (DRL); edge caching; federated learning; Internet of Things (IoT)","5G mobile communication systems; Base stations; Digital storage; Hierarchical clustering; Internet of things; Learning systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Reinforcement learning; Global networks; Internet of thing (IOT); Learning disabilities; Network overloads; Network traffic; Replacement strategy; Storage capability; Storage resources; Deep learning",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107363711

In recent years, the emerging technologies of wireless powered communication network (WPCN) and physical-layer security (PLS) are regarded as potential solutions to allow IoT nodes to harvest energy from radio frequency (RF) and ensure the secure data delivery. How to efficiently allocate energy for IoT devices to improve throughput while guaranteeing secure data transmission is a challenging problem. In this article, we consider a WPCN with the existence of an eavesdropper, who is trying to eavesdrop the data transmitted from a certain node to the hybrid sink ( H -sink). In the proposed system, the nodes first harvest energy from the H -sink, then transmit the information to the H -sink and generate interference to the eavesdropper. We first formulate the sum-throughput maximization problem as the nonlinear optimization problem and find its closed-form solution by the Lagrangian method. We further design an efficient algorithm to obtain the optimal numerical results to make up for the defect that the closed-form solution may not meet the explicit constraints.

Specifically, taking the angle-dependent probabilistic LoS channel into account, we derive the mathematical expression of the amount of the transmitted data of the GDs and model the energy consumption of the UAV.

The distributed nature of such a network and the difficulty of remote access make it more demanding to design an energy-efficient WSN. Moreover, long-range and low-power wireless connectivity is a challenge in IoT-connected applications. Present WSN topologies deal mainly with fixed SNs, SN distribution, and fixed data sink (DS). The majority of the control layer is implemented in the lower hierarchical layer or in a virtual middle layer, which reduces the network lifetime due to excessive processing and data transmission activities. This article proposes a real-time lightweight dynamic clustering algorithm (LDCA) for a WSN that supports the following two scenarios with limited processing resources: 1) with mobile DSs and static SNs (such as DS and SNs mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous vehicles) and 2) with mobile SNs and static DSs (such as livestock monitoring or autonomous robots in smart farming, and urban monitoring). The proposed algorithm is based on the received signal strength indicator and signal-to-noise ratio of a long-range (LoRa) interface and its residual energy. Mathematical models were derived for real-time clustering using LoRa. Memory requirement and clustering efficiency of the constrained SN and DS for various mobility scenario were evaluated. The proposed LDCA reduces the energy requirement to 33% compared to static clustering, by reducing the number of concurrent clusters and hops. In addition, a hardware-based approach was used to validate the LDCA algorithm, and evaluate its performance in terms of energy efficiency, packet delivery rate, and network lifetime. © 2014 IEEE.","Dynamic clustering; Internet of Things (IoT); lightweight algorithm; long-range (LoRa); mobile sensor node (SN); mobile sink; wireless sensor network (WSN)","Agriculture; Antennas; Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Sensor nodes; Signal to noise ratio; Wide area networks; Dynamic clustering algorithm; Energy requirements; Hardware-based approach; Internet of Things (IOT); Memory requirements; Processing resources; Received signal strength indicators; Wide area monitoring; Clustering algorithms",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105887041

These two factors limit their ability to connect directly to cloud servers through a wireless backbone network without imposing a burden on this network in providing efficient data transfer. In this article, we consider an IoT network architecture where a number of different IoT devices send their data wirelessly to an IoT gateway (or a fog node) via a WiFi network. We focus on characterizing incoming traffic patterns to the gateway for three typical IoT applications with real-time and nonreal-time data transfer requirements, such as video surveillance, smart city, and e-healthcare. Our study is based on generating real IoT traffic traces in a lab environment from various sensors and devices for the aforementioned applications and employing these traces to emulate a network of IoT nodes connected to a gateway via WiFi. In the conducted experiments, different homogenous and nonhomogeneous traffic patterns of the selected applications are examined for synchronized and unsynchronized data sources. Based on our empirical data, the experimental results reveal that the packet interarrival time distribution at the gateway is close to generalized Pareto distribution for homogeneous eHealth and smart city traffic, whereas the Weibull distribution is the nearest to model the empirical packet interarrival time for the rest of the examined traffic patterns. Moreover, we show that employing the experimental findings to analyze the delay performance of connecting the gateway to the cloud, given certain backbone network resources, leads to accurate results. © 2014 IEEE.","Characterization; fog; gateway; interarrival time distribution; Internet of Things (IoT); traffic; WiFi","Data transfer; Gateways (computer networks); Network architecture; Network security; Pareto principle; Security systems; Smart city; Weibull distribution; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Application-oriented; Back-bone network; Delay performance; Generalized Pareto Distributions; Inter-arrival time; Internet of Things (IOT); Video surveillance; Wireless backbone; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105861452

One of the most important issues is how to efficiently deploy edge servers under a certain budget with the explosive growth of data scale and user base. Existing studies for edge server placement fail to consider user's query preferences since individual users may be interested in events in particular regions and are keen to receive up-to-date data streams that originate in regions of interest. In this article, we present a preference-aware edge server placement approach that offers better workload distribution in terms of both minimizing query latency and balancing the load of edge servers. To achieve this, we formulate edge server placement with multiobjective optimization as a p -center problem and design two progressive approaches. We first propose quadratic integer programming (QIP) for small-scale data sets. Since the p -center problem is an NP-hard problem, we thus propose a heuristic algorithm named TAKG (TAbu search with K -means and Genetic algorithm) for large-scale data sets. To evaluate the utility of the proposed models, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation on a large data set that is collected by more than 1900 IoT devices during 30 days. Experimental results indicate our approaches outperform all baselines significantly in terms of both query latency and load balancing. © 2014 IEEE.","Edge server deployment; Internet of Things (IoT); multiobjective optimization; query latency; user preference","Budget control; Data streams; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; K-means clustering; Large dataset; Multiobjective optimization; NP-hard; Tabu search; Comprehensive evaluation; Explosive growth; Large-scale datasets; P-center problems; Quadratic integer programming; Query latency; Regions of interest; Work-load distribution; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105857841

Among those promising services, the time-series activities-based healthcare monitoring service is highly regarded due to its popularity. Meanwhile, with the rapidly growing volume of healthcare data, an emerging trend is to outsource the time-series activities-based healthcare monitoring models and the corresponding services to a cloud, which, however, inevitably entails privacy concerns. Although many existing works have put forth some solutions for privacy-preserving time-series activities-based healthcare monitoring, they are not applicable to the outsourced scenario with a single-server setting. To address the challenge, in this article, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving forward algorithm (PPFA) and further apply PPFA to construct a remote healthcare monitoring scheme over the cloud. To the best of our knowledge, our PPFA is the first privacy-preserving forward algorithm over cloud while without any accuracy loss. In addition, our remote healthcare monitoring scheme is also the first privacy-preserving hidden Markov model-based healthcare monitoring scheme in the single-server setting. Detailed security analysis shows that our PPFA and healthcare monitoring scheme are indeed privacy preserving. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted, and the results also demonstrate their efficiencies. © 2014 IEEE.","eHealthcare; healthcare monitoring; hidden Markov model (HMM); privacy; time-series activities","Health care; Internet of things; Monitoring; Time series; Emerging trends; Extensive simulations; Forward algorithms; Healthcare monitoring; Internet of thing (IOT); Privacy concerns; Privacy preserving; Security analysis; Privacy by design",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105847054

However, the improvements imposed by this new paradigm fall short in large scale mobile wireless distributed environments inherent to IoT, due to high node mobility, dynamic topologies and intermittent connectivity. To tackle these issues, we present a named data network (NDN)-based publish-subscribe mechanism with support for both Consumer and Producer mobility. This approach handles the Producer mobility by combining the Data packets with infrastructure specific information, fixing the broken paths between the Producer and the Consumer; and the Consumer mobility by monitoring and anticipating mobile node trajectories while compelling the infrastructure to adjust to new paths. Simulation results, assuming a smart city use case and using real traces of vehicular mobility, have shown that the proposed solution far surpasses the native NDN workflow and traditional publish-subscribe solutions. With respect to the Producer mobility, the proposed solution delivers 79% of Data packets against 14% with the Native implementation, when using 25 mobile Producers; regarding the Consumer mobility, results have shown that our solution achieves almost the same Consumer satisfaction ratio as previous implementations but reducing substantially the network overhead related with the transmission of Interest packets. © 2014 IEEE.","Internet of Things (IoT); mobility management; named data networks (NDNs); performance evaluation; pub-sub model","Data communication systems; Consumer mobilities; Consumer satisfactions; Distributed environments; Information Centric Networks; Intermittent connectivity; Named data networks; Specific information; Vehicular mobilities; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103275344

The privacy security is also a growing problem. The existing works use earphones, covert, and user-friendly wearable devices, for user authentication. However, some of the earphone-based authentication solutions need to customize special earphones, which are not universal. Other solutions use microphones and speakers of earphones for authentication, which are susceptible to changes in the auricle's internal environment, resulting in a decline in performance. To solve this problem, a new authentication solution based on the existing commercial earphones is proposed to authenticate a user by tapping on the earphone rhythmically. This rhythmic tap behavior causes a change of the signal waveform of the built-in accelerometer in the earphone. Based on this, we design a pipeline to authenticate the user's identity. We first design an event detection algorithm to segment the tap signal accurately. Then, we use the global features calculated based on the event detection algorithm and local features extracted from the convolutional neural network (CNN) for building an authentication model using the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier. Finally, 20 users are recruited to evaluate the experiment and the recognition accuracy reaches 98%. Moreover, we extend the experiment to prove that it has a good performance against the different attacks and is robust in different scenarios. © 2014 IEEE.","Accelerometer; earphone; tap gesture; user authentication","Barium compounds; Convolutional neural networks; Earphones; Internet of things; Privacy by design; Signal detection; Wearable sensors; Wireless sensor networks; Authentication models; Authentication solutions; Event detection algorithm; Information transmission; Information-centric; Internet of thing (IOT); Recognition accuracy; User authentication; Authentication",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102314368

Actively pushing all content to users causes much unnecessary resource consumption in the UIoT. The information-centric networking (ICN) architecture opens new horizons up for these challenges. However, the slowness of underwater propagation speed makes traditional ICN not suitable for UIoT, especially considering about delay time. In this article, we propose an information-centric wireless sensor networking scheme with water-depth-aware content caching (ICWSN-WDA) to solve the above challenges. First, we design a naming scheme and a hybrid communication mode suitable for ICWSN-WDA. The communication mode in underwater we design is divided into push and pull traffic, which balances energy consumption and delay time. Second, we define a push level to decide which water depth the content actively pushes to, finding a suitable junction point of two modes. Third, as the water depth is deeper, it becomes more difficult to replace the sensor battery. To save energy consumption of deep-water sensors, the water-depth-aware caching mechanism is proposed based on water depth, popularity, and senor energy. Our extensive evaluation confirms the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, and it balances energy consumption constraints and latency. © 2014 IEEE.","Caching; information-centric networking (ICN); Underwater Internet of Things (UIoT); water-depth-awareness","Energy utilization; Marine communication; Wireless sensor networks; Communication mode; Energy consumption constraints; Hybrid communication modes; Information-centric; Information-centric networkings (ICN); Resource consumption; Underwater propagation; Wireless sensor networkings; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100839337

Amongst these enabling technologies, device-to-device(D2D) communication is one of the critical factors for scaling up the network efficiency in 5G communication. Intermittent connections due to higher mobility lead to frequent path breaks, and hence a mobility-based opportunistic routing is suitable enough to control the forwarding process. Opportunistic networks (OppNet) use the pairwise opportunistic contacts and higher mobility to rely on the store-carry and forward mechanism for routing purpose. In this work, a novel mobility-induced context-based routing process has been designed to support D2D communication. The designed Markov random field-induced protocol (MrFbP) is based on spatial entropy for capturing the coverage span of the forwarding node in the network. The work relies on the monitored historic mobility of a node and is then used to capture the utility metric for taking forwarding decision.

In addition, the technique may reduce the communication traffic between the cloud and the edge devices. Since the available resources in the edge devices are limited, in the proposed approach, we suggest a heuristic technique for generating a smaller network based on the main network in cloud. Next, by exploiting the knowledge distillation method, the knowledge of the main network is transferred to the generated small network. In this approach, small networks on the edge devices under different datasets are trained where some of their parameters are aggregated for updating the main network parameters on the cloud. The effectiveness of this approach is assessed with some state-of-the-art neural networks.

With the development of artificial intelligence, the backward interval and synergy interval techniques were proposed in combination use with the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) method, for adaptive selection of the informative spectral wavelength variables. The radial basis function (RBF) kernel is applied for nonlinear mapping. The regulation parameter and the kernel width are fused together for smart optimization. In the design for waveband autofittings, the total of digital wavelengths in the full scanning range was split into 43 equivalent subintervals, and then, the back interval LSSVM (biLSSVM) and the synergy interval LSSVM (siLSSVM) models were both established for the improvement of prediction results based on the adaptive selection of quasidiscrete variable combination.

At the same time, with the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the construction of the IoT based on UAVs can break away from the traditional single-line communication mode of UAVs and control terminals, which makes the UAVs more intelligent and flexible when performing tasks. When using UAVs to perform IoT tasks, it is necessary to track the UAVs' position and pose at all times. When the position and pose tracking fails, relocalization is required to restore the current position and pose. Therefore, how to perform UAV relocalization accurately by using visual information has attracted much attention. However, the complex changes in light conditions in the real world have brought huge challenges to the visual relocalization of UAV. Traditional visual relocalization algorithms mostly rely on artificially designed low-level geometric features which are sensitive to light conditions. In this paper, oriented to the UAV-based IoT, a UAV visual relocalization method using semantic object features is proposed. Specifically, the method uses YOLOv3 as the object detection framework to extract the semantic information in the picture and uses the semantic information to construct a topological map as a sparse description of the environment. With prior knowledge of the map, the random walk algorithm is used on the association graphs to match the semantic features and the scenes.

The traditional centralized network architecture cannot fulfill IoT devices demand because of the heavy network traffic in industrial IoT. Moreover, IoT devices have limited computational ability and battery power. Energy consumption and time delay problems during computation offloading are fundamental issues. A new architecture known as mobile edge computing (MEC) was introduced to overcome these issues, which brings cloud services and its contents to the edge of the network. IoT devices can offload the data for computation to the cloud server or edge nodes. Different schemes have been proposed to overcome this problem under many scenarios (i.e., single-user, multiuser, and vehicular networks). In this paper, we proposed a modified delay mitigation Levenshtein distance algorithm (MDML). We consider an industrial scenario with multiple IoT devices and multiple servers (edge nodes). Each edge node consists of one MEC server. The proposed algorithm solves the offloading optimization problem of energy and mitigation of time delay with much lower complexity while significantly reducing offloading tasks' execution time. It works on the basis of dynamic programming, where we break down a complex problem into subproblems. Performance evaluation of our proposed algorithm shows that it can achieve satisfactory energy efficiency and mitigate time delay in the industrial IoT environment. © 2022 Ahsan Rafiq et al.",,"Complex networks; Dynamic programming; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Green computing; Mobile edge computing; Network architecture; Time delay; Timing circuits; Application networks; Computation offloading; Distance algorithm; Edge nodes; Energy delay; Explosive growth; Levenshtein distance; Network traffic volumes; New applications; Time-delays; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125124964

It can help users in this field get an advantage in terms of enhanced touchless authentication, especially in spreading infectious diseases like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Even though there is a number of available security systems, they suffer from one or more of issues, such as identity fraud, loss of keys and passwords, or spreading diseases through touch authentication tools. To overcome these issues, IoT-based intelligent control medical authentication systems using DL models are proposed to enhance the security factor of medical and healthcare places effectively. This work applies IoT with DL models to recognize human faces for authentication in smart control medical systems. We use Raspberry Pi (RPi) because it has low cost and acts as the main controller in this system. The installation of a smart control system using general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins of RPi also enhanced the antitheft for smart locks, and the RPi is connected to smart doors. For user authentication, a camera module is used to capture the face image and compare them with database images for getting access. The proposed approach performs face detection using the Haar cascade techniques, while for face recognition, the system comprises the following steps. The first step is the facial feature extraction step, which is done using the pretrained CNN models (ResNet-50 and VGG-16) along with linear binary pattern histogram (LBPH) algorithm. The second step is the classification step which can be done using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Only classified face as genuine leads to unlock the door; otherwise, the door is locked, and the system sends a notification email to the home/medical place with detected face images and stores the detected person name and time information on the SQL database. The comparative study of this work shows that the approach achieved 99.56% accuracy compared with some different related methods. © 2022 Tahir Hussain et al.",,"Authentication; Coronavirus; Crime; Deep learning; Health care; Internet of things; Support vector machines; Coronaviruses; Face images; Healthcare systems; Identity fraud; In-control; Infectious disease; Learning models; Medical systems; Spreading disease; Touchless; Face recognition",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125124694

Designing a management system integrating business and finance can effectively maintain the stability of user's (enterprises) development. Besides, all aspects of the designed system should be carefully divided and upgraded to adapt to the complex internal operation mode of some enterprise users.

It is already known that there are two key factors that constrain IoT localization performance, namely, the presence of outliers in the inter-node ranging data and the difficulty to guarantee that ranging is carried out between all nodes, which means that we are dealing with an incomplete Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) contaminated with outliers. In this paper, we propose a robust localization framework, termed low-rank approximation-based localization (LRAbL). LRAbL enables network localization in a stepwise manner using partially observed EDMs that contain coarse noise (outliers). Specifically, the working process of LRAbL can be divided into three stages: the preprocessing of the observed EDM, aiming to eliminate outliers with large values, the use of low-rank approximation means to obtain the complete EDM, and finally the application of non-classical MDS to calculate the coordinates of the nodes in the network. To confirm the applicability of the proposed framework, extensive numerical experiments were conducted, which indicated that LRAbL was still able to achieve satisfactory localization results when the network links were sparse (only about 1/4 of the entries can be observed) and contained a certain percentage of large value outliers. In summary, our work provides a solution worthy of consideration for location-based services in the future Internet of Things.

However, deploying edge servers could be difficult or even impossible in hostile terrain or emergency areas where the network is down. Therefore, edge servers are mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to support task offloading in such scenarios. However, the challenge is that the UAV has limited energy, and IoT tasks are delay-sensitive. In this paper, a UAV-based offloading strategy is proposed where first, the IoT devices are dynamically clustered considering the limited energy of UAVs, and task delays, and second, the UAV hovers over each cluster head to process the offloaded tasks. The optimization problem of dynamically determining the optimal number of clusters, specifying the member tasks of each cluster, is modeled as a mixed-integer, nonlinear constraint optimization. A discrete differential evolution (DDE) algorithm with new mutation and crossover operators is proposed for the formulated optimization problem, and compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) meta-heuristics. Further, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is employed to identify the shortest path over the cluster heads for the UAV to traverse. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed offloading strategy in terms of tasks delays and UAV energy consumption. © 2022 Mousa and Hussein.

Health management cannot only improve the physical condition of students but also cultivate students' strong will. Then, the application and characteristics of IoT are described, and the framework of physical exercise is designed based on IoT. Finally, a questionnaire survey is designed, and the survey results are compared and analyzed. According to the statistical results of the intervention group and the control group before and after the intervention, it is found that physical exercise has a significant effect on improving the physical and mental states of college students. The average scores of each dimension of physical states after the intervention are higher than those before the intervention, and the scores of each symptom in mental illnesses are lower than those before the intervention. This shows that the main method of health management based on physical exercise has a very obvious positive effect, which helps college students to improve their physical and mental states and cultivate their good habit of taking exercise. © 2022 - IOS Press.

All these applications ask for secure processors that can be embedded in the IoT devices. Furthermore, these devices are restricted in terms of computing capabilities, memory, and power consumption. A major challenge is how to meet the need for security in such resource-constrained devices. This paper presents a customized version of LEON3, the ReonV RISCV (Reduced Instruction Set Computer-five) processor, dedicated for IoT applications that has strong effective security mechanisms built in at the design stage. Firstly, efficient lightweight cipher designs are elaborated and validated. Then, the proposed cryptographic instructions (PRESENT and PRINCE) are integrated into the default instruction set architecture of the ReonV processor core. The instruction set extensions (ISE) of lightweight cipher modules can be instantiated in software routines exactly as the instructions of the base architecture. A single instruction is needed to implement a full lightweight cryptographic instruction. The customized ReonV RISCV processor is implemented on a Xilinx FPGA platform and is evaluated for Slice LUTs plus FF-pairs, frequency, and throughput.

Security poses a fundamental requirement factor in most IoT applications particularly, secure routing among the IoT nodes. The aim of this paper is to develop secure routing in IoT with minimal delay, minimal energy consumption and high throughput. Thus, a new algorithm, named Rider Foraging Optimization algorithm (RFO) is designed by the incorporation of standard Rider Optimization algorithm (ROA) and Bacterial Foraging optimization algorithm (BFO) that render an optimal solution, which is the optimal path for transmitting the information. Initially, the trust of the nodes is evaluated and the cluster head (CH) is chosen based on Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol to securely transmit the data. Then, the proposed RFO algorithm selects the optimal path using the fitness factors, such as trust, energy, and delay constraints. The results revealed that the energy consumption of the nodes is reduced and the lifetime of the network is enhanced through the implementation of the proposed RFO, which attained a maximal throughput of 1, and minimal delay and energy consumption of 0.1169 and 0.0002, respectively. © 2022 - IOS Press.

Agriculture provides a means of subsistence for a sizable portion of the world's population. Additionally, it provides a large number of work opportunities for inhabitants.

The primary issues in agricultural production include decision-making, crop selection, and supporting systems for crop yield enhancement. Agriculture forecasting is influenced by natural variables such as temperature, soil fertility, water volume, water quality, season, and crop prices. Growing advancements in agricultural automation have resulted in a flood of tools and apps for rapid knowledge acquisition. Mobile devices are rapidly being used by everyone, including farmers.

By September 14, 2021, there were 224+ million confirmed cases and 4.6+ million fatalities world-wide [1]. Internet of Things (IoT)-based quarantine strategies effectively slow down and prevent COVID-19 transmission [2]. However, the unstan-dardized quarantine strategy may cause negative consequences. Typically, quarantine deactivates normal economic interactions, thus causing huge economic loss [3]. Moreover, the lack of versatility and resiliency also brings safety challenges on some occasions. In this investigation, a performance scoring quarantine index, referred to as QDex, is developed to provide guidance for a new concept of dynamic geofencing quarantine directive. QDex evaluation features adaptive dynamic geofencing (QEDG) for quarantine. In QEDG, QDex is newly defined to evaluate the dynamic geofencing in relation to epidemic control and economic loss. They are represented by two formulated indicators, namely the transmission risk (TR) and the active profit (AP), which are related to the isolator bio status (e.g., body temperature). Based on the evaluation results of TR and AP, QEDG provides a proper geofencing indication for quarantine, which decreases epidemic transmission and restores economic recovery.

To address this challenge, we propose a fine-grained identification method based on the camera devices' inherent features.

A design feature similarity calculation strategy (FSCS) for each type of feature is established. Then the feature weights are determined based on feature entropy. Finally, we present a device similarity model based on the FSCS and feature weights. And we use this model to identify the fine-grained type of a target device.

We focus on the information about the local changes of nodes and edges in the current graph, analyze the impact of such local changes on this current graph, and then use the idea behind wave propagation theory to seek and determine all affected nodes that need to be updated their PageRank in the new graph. For new nodes, the existing nodes in the current graph that are connected with these new nodes are aggregated into a supernode, and the PageRank of the new nodes is solved in the new graph with the supernode. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments on real-world and synthetic graph datasets.

In DI, computational tasks are offloaded from the IoT device to the edge server via lossy IoT networks. However, generally, there is a communication system-level trade-off between communication latency and reliability; thus, to provide accurate DI results, a reliable and high-latency communication system is required to be adapted, which results in non-negligible end-to-end latency of the DI. This motivated us to improve the trade-off between the communication latency and accuracy by efforts on ML techniques. Specifically, we have proposed a communication-oriented model tuning (COMtune), which aims to achieve highly accurate DI with low-latency but unreliable communication links. In COMtune, the key idea is to fine-tune the ML model by emulating the effect of unreliable communication links through the application of the dropout technique. This enables the DI system to obtain robustness against unreliable communication links. Our ML experiments revealed that COMtune enables accurate predictions with low latency and under lossy networks. © 2013 IEEE.","Communication-efficiency; Delay-aware system; Distributed inference; Machine learning; Packet loss tolerant","Deep learning; Distributed computer systems; Economic and social effects; Internet of things; Job analysis; Communication efficiency; Communications systems; Delay aware; Delay-aware system; Distributed inference; Packet loss tolerant; Packets loss; Robustness; Task analysis; Packet loss",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124714384

Using the secondary power beacon, which plays a role as radio frequency (RF) source when there is no ambient RF source signals, with spectrum sensing capability, the secondary ABC system determines operation modes according to activity of the licensed primary system. When the primary system is active, a tag is randomly selected due to a lack of channel information, while when it is inactive, the best tag maximizing achievable rate is selected using the secondary power beacon. Moreover, we apply a successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique when the secondary power beacon is able to work. The performance of the proposed multi-tag selection schemes is mathematically analyzed in terms of bit error rate (BER) and achievable rate. Finally, the performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated through simulations in terms of BER and achievable rate.

In this article, a multigroup-based Phasmatodea population evolution algorithm with mutistrategy (MPPE) is proposed to further improve the overall performance of PPE. During the initialization period, the stick insect population is divided into multiple groups, and the step factor of the flower pollen algorithm is introduced into the population growth model of no more than half of the groups. This makes the population evolution trend diversified and prevents the algorithm from falling into the local optimal solution to a certain extent.

The Industrial Internet of Things includes industrial applications such as robots, medical devices, and software-defined manufacturing processes. In terms of energy conservation, routing is extremely essential. The creation of an energy effectual steering procedure leads to a substantial rise in energy consumption. To minimize network traffic and increase network life, the article presented an Industrial IoT Fuzzy Logic Energy-Aware Routing Protocol (FLEA-RPL), which decreases network traffic as well as improves network life. The most suitable parent for data transfer is selected based on, among other things, the routing parameters charge, residual energy, and expected transmission count. Since the load routing metric is taken into consideration during the construction of the route, the data traffic is spread across the network. This increases network's lifetime while maintaining a high packet delivery ratio. The proposed work proposes a Multilayer Energy-Aware Aware RPL (MCEA-RPL) cluster for the Internet of Things to decrease network data traffic while increasing the lifetime of the network. It is split into three phases, each including the creation of network rings, intraring divisions, and intercluster routing. First and foremost, the virtual ring is created in the network. Secondly, each ring forms an identical cluster and chooses the CH node. Finally, it is responsible for the maintenance and performance of the DODAG. Data transfer from the lesser sheet to the DODAG root is known as data transfer. By using Blockchain technology, the lifetime of a network may be extended by reducing the number of identical data package transfers. This article offers Enhanced Mobility Support RPL (EM-RPL) in Industrial IoT which enhances mobility support with blockchain and spreads system generation. It comprises two processes: a collection of the parental static node and selection of the parent moving node. The static parent selection method uses routing metrics load and residual energy to identify the parent that is most suited for data transfer. Two phases of mobile parent selection must be distinguished: data transmission and route rediscovery. The mobile node utilizes furious logic to compute the hand-off value of the metric packet errors ratio and the signal strength indication received from the base station. If the hand-off value exceeds the threshold limit, the DODAG route has to be changed to work correctly. The EM-RPL thus increases the package delivery rate by reducing the amount of route interruption caused by mobility, while offering an efficient handling mechanism. © 2022 Abolfazl Mehbodniya et al.",,"Application programs; Blockchain; Computer circuits; Data transfer; Fuzzy logic; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Mobile telecommunication systems; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Block-chain; Data traffic; Energy aware routing protocols; Fuzzy-Logic; Mobility supports; Network lives; Network traffic; Residual energy; Routing metrics; Routings; Energy utilization",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124701914

Business intelligence tools have removed many of the obstacles to data visibility, and numerous data mining technologies are playing an essential role in this visibility. However, the increase in big data has also led to an increase in ‘dark data’, data that does not have any predefined structure and is not generated intentionally. In this paper, we show how dark data can be mined for practical purposes and utilized to gain business insight. The most common type of dark data is a log file generated on a web server. Using the example of log files generated by e-commerce transactions, this paper shows how residual data and data trails can prove to be valuable when an actual dataset is inaccessible, and explains the usage of residual data for modeling purposes. The work uses a system identification approach, based on natural language processing for log file tokenization and feature extraction. The features are then embedded into the next step, which uses a deep neural network to identify customers for targeted advertising. The results achieve a significant accuracy and show how dark data has the potential to deliver value for business.

However, the amount of fertilizer needs to be limited to prevent unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions such as N2O. However, the measurement of N2O gas in agricultural settings is challenging, generally frequiring complex systems. The development and evaluation of a new nitrous oxide (N2O) gas measurement system for agricultural fields is described. This system consists of an Infra- Red (IR) N2O gas sensors module placed within an acrylic chamber and located in a agricultural field. It is connected to an Internet of Things (IoT) module for recording gas level measurements in the cloud database, thus permitting monitoring of the measurements in realtime using a mobile phone. Firstly, measurements were taken using standard gas to evaluate the characteristic of the sensor module. Susequently, the measurement system was tested in two experimental fields for 4 days with 10 mg urea fertilizer applied in each case. The measurement results using standard gas showed that the IR sensor module produced adequate result compared with the measurement using Gas Chromatography (GC).

Although unequal clustering is an effective technique for alleviating the ""energy holes""problem in multihop communication, resource scheduling based on unequal clustering is scarcely conducted. In the present study, a new resource scheduling based on unequal clustering in the Internet of Things (RSUC) is proposed. In RSUC, unequal clustering and multihop routing are considered, and the ""energy holes""problem is alleviated effectively. RSUC includes resource scheduling of intracluster communication and intercluster communication. In resource scheduling of intracluster communication, according to the threshold of the number of cluster members, the cluster heads (CHs) recycle resources of failed nodes. In resource scheduling of intercluster communication, CHs in the different layers based on transmission chain obtain different sending and receiving time slots. In RSUC, CHs that are near the base station (BS) have fewer intracluster communication time slots and more intercluster communication time slots. Clusters that are further away from the BS end intercluster communication earlier and enter into intracluster communication instead of waiting for all CHs to complete intercluster communication.

The accuracy of the BKNN-ELM algorithm in classification of water quality status produced the highest accuracy of the highest accuracy which is K=9 and k=10 with rate of accuracy which is 93.56%, and the lowest accuracy is K=1 of 65.34%. Experiment evaluation shows that a total suspended solid predicted by proposed model is 91 with accuracy of 93%. The relative error rate of prediction is 12.03 which is lesser than existing models. © 2022 Anwer Mustafa Hilal et al.",,"Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Chemical oxygen demand; Health risks; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Water quality; Carbon-based; ELM algorithms; High-accuracy; Machine learning algorithms; Nitrogen phosphorous; Polluted water; Total nitrogen; Total phosphorous; Total suspended solids; Waste water treatment plants; Forecasting",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124649771

(H2TEC) comprises unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that act as mobile fog nodes to provide the required services for terminal nodes (TNs) in cooperation with the satellites. TNs in (H2TEC) offload their generated tasks to the UAVs for further processing. Due to the limited energy budget of TNs, a novel task allocation protocol, named TOP, is proposed to minimize the energy consumption of TNs while guaranteeing the outage probability and network reliability for which the transmission rate of TNs is optimized. TOP also takes advantage of the energy harvesting by which the low earth orbit satellites transfer energy to the UAVs when the remaining energy of the UAVs is below a predefined threshold. To this end, the harvested power of the UAVs is optimized alongside the corresponding harvesting time so that the UAVs can improve the network throughput via processing more bits. Numerical results reveal that TOP outperforms the baseline method in critical situations that more power is required to process the task. It is also found that even in such situations, the energy harvesting mechanism provided in the TOP yields a more efficient network throughput. © 2022 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers","Energy harvesting (EH); Fog computing; Internet of Things (IoT); K-means clustering; Low earth orbit (LEO) satellites; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Antennas; Budget control; Edge computing; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fog computing; Internet of things; Internet protocols; K-means clustering; Network architecture; Numerical methods; Orbits; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Energy harvesting; Internet of thing; Internet of things architectures; K-means++ clustering; Low earth orbit satellites; Network throughput; Power; Task allocation protocol; Terminal nodes; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Energy harvesting",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124649568

Current SDRs perform well in battery-equipped systems, but fail to support miniaturized IoT devices with stringent hardware and power constraints. This paper takes the first step toward designing an ultra-low-power SDR that satisfies the ultra-low-power or even battery-free requirements of intelligent and simplified IoT networks. To achieve this goal, the core technique is the effective integration of µW-level backscatter in our SDR to sidestep power-hungry active radio frequency chains. We carefully develop a novel circuit design for efficient energy harvesting and power control, and devise a competent solution for eliminating the harmonic and mirror frequencies caused by backscatter hardware. We evaluate the proposed SDR using different modulation schemes, and it achieves a high data rate of 100 kb/s with power consumption less than 200 µW in the active mode and as low as 10 µW in the sleep mode.

From the viewpoint of final measurement, there are two kinds of effects: bias-only measurement and error-growth measurement. The bias-only measurement can be directly read from a sensing device, and each measurement is only distorted by the inherited bias error of the sensor, e.g., measuring temperature by a thermometer sensor. On the other hand, the error-growth measurement cannot be read directly but be calculated by combining multiple former sampling data, therefore multiple bias errors are accumulated in the measurement. For instance, in inertial navigation, the raw data sampled from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are converted into a trajectory by multiple integral operations, so the errors of new sampling data are continuously added into the trajectory, and the deviation of the traced trajectory will reach an unacceptable level over time. Clearly, a good IMU trajectory strategy is the one with a less error-accumulation effect. Unfortunately, the analysis of error-growth effect remains not well studied, which motivates this work. This letter first proposes a theoretical error-growth effect analysis framework.

Many countries are also making use of Internet of Thing technology to carry out intelligent electricity network reform. One of the reform goals is balancing the supply and demand of electricity, which has become a top priority. Balancing electricity supply and demand through real-time electricity prices has become an effective way. However, using traditional machine learning models for real-time electricity price prediction requires complex feature engineering, and the results are not satisfactory. Also, the mainstream fusion methods use data-level fusion, which will put very high pressure on communication bandwidth and computer resources. In this paper, an LSTM- (long short-term memory-) based decision level fusion of multisource data is proposed and applied for real-time electricity price prediction on actual electricity price datasets. The method solves the difficulties of traditional machine learning models in dealing with complex nonlinear problems. It achieves local asynchronous processing of multisource data through decision-level fusion, reducing the requirement for bandwidth resources and providing perfect results in real-time electricity price prediction.

Therefore, it is very necessary to study multimedia forensics technology for IoT security. In the edge-cloud IoT environment, an image anomaly detection technology for security service is proposed in this paper. First, preprocessing is performed before image anomaly detection. Then, we extracted sparse features from the image to roughly localize the region of anomaly detection. Feature extraction based on the polar cosine transform (PCT) is then performed only on the candidate region of anomaly detection. To further improve the detection accuracy, we use iterative updating. This method makes use of the feature that the edge node is closer to the multimedia source in physical location and migrates the complex computing task of image anomaly detection from the cloud computing center to the edge node. Provide a security service for abnormal data and deploy it to the edge-cloud server to reduce the pressure on the cloud. Overall, preprocessing improves the ability of feature extraction in smooth or small region of anomaly detections, and the iterative strategy enhances the security service.

Therefore, we aim to create a model using objective data for detecting anomalies in physical condition. In this study, data from 13 subjects in a care facility were collected, and isolation forest models were constructed for each subject. The subject’s anomalies in physical condition were documented in a care record by a nurse and used as reference for model evaluation. Recall and specificity were used to evaluate the model, expressed as the percentage of detection success for abnormal or normal conditions.

From the perspective of the realization of personalized customization functions, this article solves the problem of dynamic analysis of alternative elements in the automated packaging system. We analyze the connection mechanism and interaction method between the cloud service system layer and the mobile terminal service layer, and carry out the corresponding software design. From the perspective of the realization of the intelligent production of the system in this paper, this topic mainly studies the information interaction mechanism and production control mechanism of the cloud service system and the manufacturing system. Based on the hardware of the manufacturing system layer, a flexible production implementation mechanism is formulated to make it the basis for the implementation of intelligent production of the system. Based on the massive data processing capabilities of the cloud service system, the information processing mechanism and the production planning decision-making mechanism are formulated for it, so as to realize the intelligent adjustment of the manufacturing system layer in the production process. For the connection scenario of IoT group paging, based on the application of NB-IoT technology in the next-generation mobile communication network, the focus of network optimization is to ensure the random access performance of IoT devices as much as possible. To this end, this paper proposes a random access optimization strategy for IoT group paging based on time slot scattering. We establish a mathematical model based on queuing theory for the connection scenario of the Io T group paging, then use the mathematical formula to derive the number of IoT devices scattered to each time slot in the initial state, thereby deriving the specific time slot scattering algorithm. This paper establishes a list of credit nodes, changes the participation mode of consensus nodes from static to dynamic, and supports voting to select trusted nodes. We designed a credit evaluation mechanism as a basis for consensus node elections to improve system's fault tolerance rate. The algorithm process was simplified, and the PBFT algorithm process was simplified from a 3-phase protocol to a 2-phase protocol to further reduce communication bandwidth overhead and algorithm time. Simulation analysis shows that, compared with the PBFT algorithm, the proposed algorithm improves node flexibility and fault tolerance while reducing communication bandwidth overhead by about 45%, packaging throughput by about 4%, and latency by about 3%. © 2022 Jian Long.",,"5G mobile communication systems; Bandwidth; Cost reduction; Decision making; Distributed database systems; Dynamics; Internet of things; Production control; Queueing theory; Analysis of alternatives; Automated packaging; Cloud services; Communication bandwidth; Dynamics analysis; Packaging system; Random access; Service systems; System layer; Timeslots; Automation",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124296427

Such a network suffers from intermittent connectivity, lack of end-To-end route definition, resource constraints and uncertainties arising from a dynamic topology, given the mobility of participating nodes. Machine learning is an instrumental tool for learning and many histories-based machine learning paradigms like MLPROPH, KNNR and GMMR have been proposed for digital transformations in the field with varying degrees of success. This paper explores the dynamic topology with a plethora of characteristics guiding the node interactions, and consequently, the routing decisions. Further, the study ascertains the need for better representation of the versatility of node characteristics that guide their behavior. The proposed scheme Opportunistic Fuzzy Clustering Routing (OFCR) protocol employs a three-Tiered intelligent fuzzy clustering-based paradigm that allows representation of multiple properties of a single entity and the degree of association of the entity with each property group that it is represented by. Such quantification of the extent of association allows OFCR a proper representation of multiple node characteristics, allowing a better judgement for message routing decisions based on these characteristics. OFCR performed 33.77%, 6.07%, 3.69%, 6.88% and 78.14% better than KNNR, GMMR, CAML, MLPRoPH and HBPR respectively across Message Delivery probability.

This growth brings up several challenging issues for a successful continuous operation of IoT applications. Some of these challenges that need to be taken care of are resource constraints, central server overload, and the risk of illegal use of private data. On the other side, Blockchain technology is increasingly popular and has gained huge success in cryptocurrencies. It offers numerous vital qualities such as a technique for consensus, peer communications, confidence-building without a trustworthy third party, and a transaction controlled by conditions and functions using the intelligent contract technique. Blockchain is an excellent candidate to establish a decentralized, autonomous IoT system addressing the above issues. This study proposes an IoT-Blockchain integration architecture using an Ethereum Blockchain infrastructure within a rich-thin client IoT approach to address the challenges created by the limited IoT resources while implementing the Blockchain mining technique in IoT systems. The architecture depends on load distribution between the resources. Limited resource devices are the thin-clients, while the higher resource devices are assigned as rich-clients. Both clients can access the blockchain and collect the data, but rich-client can only execute the mining process. In addition, we implement a healthcare system based on the proposed architecture in which surgical process management is carried out. We also prove our solution's efficiency by testing and comparing the architecture against other well-known IoT-based blockchain architectures.

In this paper, we develop a deep learning architecture called the convolutional neural network (CNN), which we examine in this study to see if it can be implemented. The study uses the IoT system with a centralised cloud server, where it is considered as an ideal input data acquisition module. The study uses cloud computing resources by distributing CNN operations to the servers with outsourced fitness functions to be performed at the edge. The results of the simulation show that the proposed method achieves a higher rate of classifying the input instances from the data acquisition tools than other methods. From the results, it is seen that the proposed CNN achieves an average accurate rate of 99.6% on training datasets and 86.3% on testing datasets. © 2022 J.

This study mainly explores the immunomodulatory effect of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides against liver fibrosis based on the intelligent medical Internet of Things. This measure emphasizes that the current effective methods and methods for the treatment of liver cancer are mainly combined treatments of Western medicine and Chinese medicine. These treatments have a certain effect in preventing liver cancer, reducing recurrence, and reducing side effects. Among them, chemotherapy has unique advantages in improving the quality of life and prolonging survival. With the development of medical science and technology, the clinical efficacy and efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of liver cancer are constantly improving. The mechanism is also studied from many aspects. The treatment time of LBPs on fibrotic hepatocytes was set to 24 h. Take liver fiber cells in logarithmic growth phase and incubate them at 37°C for 24 h. The whole process uses a temperature sensor for intelligent temperature control. In the experiment, groups of LBPs with different concentrations and different molecular weight ranges were set up and each group had 6 multiple holes. The original medium was aspirated and replaced with a medium containing different concentrations of LBPs (12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL) and cultured for 24 h. Based on the previous research, this study used in vitro cell experiments, microscopic observation, and MTT method to verify whether Lycium barbarum polysaccharides inhibit the proliferation of human liver cancer cells in vitro and whether they cooperate with the chemotherapy drug fluorouracil to play a tumor-killing effect. Animal experiments, using ELISA, HE staining, and other methods, explore the molecular and immunological mechanisms of LBP's antiliver cancer effect from the perspective of Th/Th2 differentiation balance and DC function, in order to provide experimental evidence for Chinese medicine polysaccharides in cancer immunotherapy and application. At different LBP concentrations (0 μmol/L, 5 μmol/L, 10 μmol/L, and 15 μmol/L), the inhibition rates were 0.80%, 20.06%, 35.44%, and 55.39%, respectively.

To allow the cloud server to perform comparison, search, and classification on outsourced ciphertexts while simultaneously providing privacy guarantee, the encryption method that supports the ciphertext equality test is considered as a promising way. Users are able to authorize the cloud server to conduct the ciphertext equality test, so that two ciphertexts can be determined whether they encrypt the same message without being decrypted. In this process, users do not need to retrieve, decrypt, and then perform comparison on data; thus, the computing and communication efficiency can be greatly improved, and the privacy of user data can be guaranteed at the cloud server side. However, existing encryption schemes supporting authorized ciphertext equality test in the single server model cannot resist the keyword guessing attacks, and the solutions in the dual server model do not provide simultaneous authorization on two servers. To address these issues, this paper proposes a public key encryption scheme supporting authorized equality test on ciphertexts in the dual server model (PKE-AUT), where the primary server and secondary server must get the authorization from users before performing a sequential equality test on ciphertexts. Security and performance analysis demonstrate that the proposed PKE-AUT scheme not only guarantees the privacy of user data and authorization but also is practical in cloud-assisted IoT-related applications. © 2022 Meng Zhao et al.",,"Authorization; Cloud computing; Cloud security; Data privacy; Public key cryptography; Testing; Ciphertexts; Cloud servers; Cloud-computing; Equality tests; Outsourced datum; Privacy and security; Privacy threats; Public-key encryption; Server modeling; User data; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124101966

How to realize the robust and reliable connection of massive IoT applications has become the research focus of industry and academia. However, the massive IoT industrial equipment, diverse business types, complex networking mode, and broadcast characteristics of wireless media have posed serious challenges to providing stable and reliable connections in industrial communication scenarios. In order to overcome this problem, the paper proposes an enhanced reliable access scheme (ERAS) for massive IoT applications in software-defined industrial heterogeneous networks. Based on the idea of software-defined networking (SDN), the ERAS is designed from two perspectives of the control plane and the data plane. Based on the idea of greedy algorithms, ERAS uses priority, interference set, deadline, and other information to find the local optimal solution and then obtain the global optimum. First, low-priority periodic data is accessed to the channel based on the earliest deadline. Then, high-priority data (such as control and interactive services) judges the channel occupancy status according to the access flow table, and if there is an idle channel in the current time slot, it is normally accessed. Otherwise, the subslots reserved with high priority in the control channel are used to preempt the low-priority channel. This preemption mechanism can ensure reliable and real-time connections for massive IIoT. Simulation results show that the ERAS performs better than traditional methods in terms of delay, deadline guarantee rate, and packet loss rate. © 2022 Yuhuai Peng et al.",,"5G mobile communication systems; Application programs; Complex networks; Control equipment; Internet of things; Access schemes; Automated control; Generation technologies; Higher integration; Industrial systems; Intelligent Manufacturing; Intelligent terminal; Low priorities; Reliable connections; Sensor technologies; Heterogeneous networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124099725

Digital image processing handles the digital material to store and distribute more effectively with decreased time and space complexity. However, these tactics undermine the privacy of digital materials. A recent study focuses on shielding digital materials from illicit use and distribution by making reversible data strategies to tackle the risk of privacy breaches for digital content. In this study, a composite reversible data hiding (CRDH) approach is suggested. CRDH employed the integer wavelet transform (HAAR transform) with the HH band's eigenvalue decomposition. The suggested CRDH first performed the IWT transformation on the cover image (CI) and parsed it into four consecutive frequency subbands, namely, LL, HL, LH, and HH. Sensitive data of the proposed approach are incorporated by merging the HH band of the cover image's individual values with the encrypted eigenvalues of the confidential data. The choosing of casing art is such a method that values are within a range. The confidential data picture and HH band's frequency band are roughly the same; thus, modifying the individual values will not affect the quality of the confidential data image and the HH band's content. The suggested strategy's primary purpose is to design a data concealing technique that hinders the verification of digital information by maintaining a high rate of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The PSNR of the existing technology is less than 50 per cent of the total accessible data set. The PSNR value shows the picture's visual quality, where the PSNR increases the better image quality. Therefore, concealing data is essential for the technique that inhibits authentication and keeps a high rate of PSNR. The suggested approach fulfils this aim, gets a PSNR rate of above 50 per cent, and hits 59 per cent for line. © 2022 A.

Compared to asymmetric cipher cryptography, symmetric cipher has the speed advantage required for various real-time applications. Yet, with the distribution of micro-devices and the wider utilization of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), lightweight algorithms are required to operate on such devices. This paper proposes a symmetric cipher based on a scheme consisting of multiple zigzag patterns, a secret key of variable length, and block data of variable size. The proposed system uses transposition principles to generate various encryption patterns with a particular initial point over a grid. The total number of cells in the grid and its dimension are variable. Various patterns can be created for the same grid, leading to different outcomes on different grids. For a grid of n cells, a total of n! * (n-1!) total patterns can be generated. This information is encapsulated in the private key. Thus, the huge number of possible patterns and the variation of the grid size, which are kept hidden, maintain the security of the proposed technique. Moreover, variable padding can be used; two paddings with different lengths lead to a completely different output even with the same pattern and the same inputs, which improves the security of the proposed system © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

However, in those old days, complex transceiver designs hindered the massive adoption of JSAC in many applications. Nevertheless, thanks to advancing wireless technologies in recent years, JSAC has recently attracted substantial attention for a wide range of civil and military applications. In particular, JSAC enables simultaneous sensing and communication functionalities with the full cooperation of both operations in shared resources such as hardware as well as radio resources (i.e., frequency, time, space and so on). Note that sensing functionality is associated with other sub-functionalities of radio-detection-and-ranging (Radar), computation, and localization which are sporadically used terms in the literature. Thus, to generalize the concept and avoid any confusion, we use the term 'sensing' in the acronym JSAC as a consistent and general term associated with the other aforementioned sub-functionalities.

Currently, image superresolution reconstruction technologies are widely used for obtaining high quality images. Unfortunately, the existing methods generally focus on the whole image without highlighting foreground information and lack visual focus. Also, they have low utilization of shallow features and numerous training parameters. In this paper, we propose a feature extraction module that focuses on foreground information: the parallel attention module (PAM). PAM computes channel and spatial attention in parallel, inputs the obtained attention values into a cascaded gated network, and dynamically adjusts the weights of both using nonuniform joint loss to focus on image foreground information and detail features to improve the reconstructed image's foreground sharpness. To further improve the performance, we propose to connect multiple PAM modules in series with skip connections and call it PAMNet. PAMNet can better leverage the shallow residual features, and the reconstructed images are closer to ground truth. Thereby, the applications in the urban image processing IoT systems can obtain high-resolution images more quickly and precisely. The comprehensive experimental results show that PAMNet performs better than the state-of-the-art technologies. © 2022 Yanfen Cheng et al.",,"Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Network security; Optical resolving power; Smart city; Autonomous Vehicles; Foreground information; High quality; High resolution; Image super-resolution reconstruction; Images processing; Information-aware; Reconstructed image; Smart technology; Urban surveillance; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124073694

The consumers' usage and consumption standards need to be regulated in order to improve energy efficiency (EE).

In addition, the dependency on LBS in the performance of daily tasks has increased dramatically, especially after the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. LBS users use their real location to build LBS queries to take benefits. This makes location privacy vulnerable to attacks. The privacy issue is accentuated if the attacker is an LBS provider since all information about users is accessible. Moreover, the attacker can apply advanced attacks, such as map matching and semantic location attacks. In response to these issues, this work employs artificial intelligence to build a robust defense against advanced location privacy attacks. The key idea behind protecting the location privacy of LBS users is to generate smart dummy locations. Smart dummy locations are false locations with the same query probability as the real location, but they are far from both the real location and each other. Relying on the previous two conditions, the deep-learning-based intelligent finder ensures a high level of location privacy protection against advanced attacks. The attacker cannot recognize the dummies from the real location and cannot isolate the real location by a filtering process.

In sizeable outdoor deployment regions, the edge-devices may experience poor connectivity due to their distant locations and limited transmission power. Repeaters or relays must be placed at a few locations to ensure reliable connectivity to either a gateway or another node in the network. A big challenge in achieving reliable connectivity and coverage is the outdoor propagation environment being heterogeneous. Engineers often deploy networks based on resource-intensive field visits, detailed surveys, measurements, initial test deployments, followed by fine-tuning. For scalability to large scale IoT deployments, automated network planning tools are essential. Such tools should predict connectivity based on the edge-device locations using available Geographical Information System (GIS) data, identify the need for relays/repeaters, and, if needed, suggest the number of relays needed with their locations. Furthermore, such tools should also be extended to suggest the minimum number and locations of base stations that maximise coverage. In this paper, we propose an automated network deployment framework using a black box received signal strength estimation oracle that provides signal strength estimates between candidate pairs of transceiver locations in a heterogeneous deployment region. Our proposed methodology uses either Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) or Differential Evolution (DE) to identify the number and locations of relays for meeting specified quality of service constraints. We discuss adaptations of our techniques to handle scenarios with multiple gateways. Further, we show the effectiveness of these algorithms to find suitable candidate base station locations to provide coverage in a heterogeneous propagation environment that meets the specified quality of service constraints. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms in two deployment regions. © 2013 IEEE.","Coverage; GIS; heterogeneous propagation environment; Internet of Things; IoT; RF propagation tool; RSSI; sub giga hertz; sub-GHz","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Base stations; Gateways (computer networks); Genetic algorithms; Geographic information systems; Information use; Internet of things; Quality of service; Coverage; Gigas; Heterogeneous propagation environment; Propagation environment; Quality of Service constraints; RF propagation; RF propagation tool; RSSI; Sub giga hertz; Sub-GHz; Location",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124068568

A reasonable and effective layout of wireless sensor networks is conducive to the monitoring of environmental quality, various transactions, and status and transmits a large number of sensing data to the data aggregation center for processing and analysis. However, the operation and development of traditional wireless sensor networks are extremely dependent on the energy supply of the network. When the corresponding supply energy is limited, the operation life of the corresponding wireless sensor network will be greatly reduced. Based on the above situation, this paper proposes a nonuniform clustering routing protocol optimization algorithm from the energy loss of cluster head and clustering form algorithm in wireless sensor networks. At the level of cluster head calculation in wireless sensor networks, firstly, based on the adaptive estimation clustering algorithm, the core density is used as the estimation element to calculate the cluster head radius of wireless sensor networks. At the same time, this paper creatively proposes a fuzzy logic algorithm to further solve the uncertainty of cluster head selection, integrate the residual energy of cluster head nodes, and finally complete the reasonable distribution of cluster heads and realize the balance of node energy consumption. In order to further reduce the algorithm overhead of transmission between cluster heads and realize energy optimization, an intercluster routing optimization algorithm based on the ant colony algorithm is proposed. The pheromone is updated and disturbed by introducing chaotic mapping to ensure the optimal solution of the algorithm, and the optimal path is selected from the perspective of energy dispersion coefficient and distance coefficient, so as to optimize the energy consumption between cluster heads. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional algorithm, the proposed nonuniform clustering routing protocol optimization algorithm prolongs the corresponding life cycle by 75% and reduces the total network energy consumption by about 20%. Therefore, the algorithm achieves the purpose of optimizing network energy consumption and prolonging network life to a certain extent and has certain practical value. © 2022 Shun Yang et al.",,"Ant colony optimization; Clustering algorithms; Energy dissipation; Fuzzy logic; Internet of things; Internet protocols; Life cycle; Power management (telecommunication); Routing protocols; Sensor nodes; Between clusters; Cluster-heads; Clustering routing protocol; Energy-consumption; Network energy consumption; Non-uniform clustering; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Protocol optimization; Sensor network technology; Energy utilization",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124068220

Second, we exploit the modified DeepWalk algorithm to learn the low-dimensional vector representations of user nodes in the heterogeneous information network and employ the clustering methods to obtain candidate spamming groups.

Thus, considering the gateway's limited storage and computational resources, a new lightweight IoT device identification scheme is proposed. First, the DFI (deep/dynamic flow inspection) technology is utilized to efficiently extract flow-related statistical features based on in-depth studies.

Especially IoT-based safety and critical applications must be more securable and reliable. Such type of applications needs to be operated continuously even in the presence of errors and faults. In safety and critical IoT applications maintaining data reliability and security is the critical task. IoT suffers from node failures due to limited resources and the nature of deployment which results in data loss consequently. This paper proposes a Data Recovery Approach for Fault Tolerant (DRAFT) IoT node algorithm, which is fully distributed, data replication and recovery implemented through redundant local database storage of other nodes in the network. DRAFT ensures high data availability even in the presence of node failures to preserve the data. When an IoT node fails in any cluster in the network data can be retrieved through redundant storage with the help of neighbor nodes in the cluster.

The issue that faces elevator passengers in case of breakdowns is the long waiting time for the arrival of the maintenance engineers to perform the repair, as the process of reporting is done manually. The safety concern increases when people are trapped. Most state-of-the-art approaches detect faults without providing means to facilitate the communication between elevator owners, maintenance companies, and engineers or notify them in case of breakdowns. Moreover, none of the proposed fault detection solutions rely on rules specified by experts in the field. This paper aims at addressing these issues by proposing a system that manages, monitors, detects faults and informs users of any faults instantly by sending notifications. Specifically, the paper proposes a mobile application, Elevint, that is, cloud-based and exploits the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Elevint provides real-time monitoring of elevator operating conditions collected from sensors. The data is then transferred to the cloud, where faults are detected by applying rules that compare the current conditions with severity levels determined by experts. In the case that a fault is detected, elevator owners and maintenance companies are automatically notified. Moreover, through Elevint, maintenance companies can assign engineers to repair the fault and elevator owners can view and re-schedule the engineer’s visit if needed.

Suitably constructed, e-Cash has the ability to offer an anonymous offline experience much akin to cash, and in direct contrast to traditional forms of payment such as credit and debit cards. Implementing security and privacy within e-Cash, i.e., preserving user anonymity while preventing counterfeiting, fraud, and double spending, is a non-trivial challenge. In this article, we propose major improvements to an e-Cash protocol, termed PUF-Cash, based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs). PUF-Cash was created as an offline-first, secure e-Cash scheme that preserved user anonymity in payments. In addition, PUF-Cash supports remote payments; an improvement over traditional currency. In this work, a novel multi-trusted-third-party exchange scheme is introduced, which is responsible for ""blinding""Alice's e-Cash tokens; a feature at the heart of preserving her anonymity. The exchange operations are governed by machine learning techniques which are uniquely applied to optimize user privacy, while remaining resistant to identity-revealing attacks by adversaries and trusted authorities. Federation of the single trusted third party into multiple entities distributes the workload, thereby improving performance and resiliency within the e-Cash system architecture. Experimental results indicate that improvements to PUF-Cash enhance user privacy and scalability. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","Digital currency; Electronic money; Internet of things; Networks; Security",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123945842

However, current camera traps suffer from two problems. First, the images are manually classified and counted, which is expensive. Second, due to manual coding, the results are often stale by the time they get to the ecologists. Using the Internet of Things (IoT) combined with deep learning represents a good solution for both these problems, as the images can be classified automatically, and the results immediately made available to ecologists. This paper proposes an IoT architecture that uses deep learning on edge devices to convey animal classification results to a mobile app using the LoRaWAN low-power, wide-area network. The primary goal of the proposed approach is to reduce the cost of the wildlife monitoring process for ecologists, and to provide real-time animal sightings data from the camera traps in the field. Camera trap image data consisting of 66,400 images were used to train the InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNetB1, DenseNet121, and Xception neural network models. While performance of the trained models was statistically different (Kruskal–Wallis: Accuracy H(5) = 22.34, p < 0.05; F1-score H(5) = 13.82, p = 0.0168), there was only a 3% difference in the F1-score between the worst (MobileNet V2) and the best model (Xception). Moreover, the models made similar errors (Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) > 0.88 and Adjusted Mutual Information (AMU) > 0.82). Subsequently, the best model, Xception (Accuracy = 96.1%; F1-score = 0.87; F1-Score = 0.97 with oversampling), was optimized and deployed on the Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, and Nvidia Jetson edge devices using both TenorFlow Lite and TensorRT frameworks. Optimizing the models to run on edge devices reduced the average macro F1-Score to 0.7, and adversely affected the minority classes, reducing their F1-score to as low as 0.18. Upon stress testing, by processing 1000 images consecutively, Jetson Nano, running a TensorRT model, outperformed others with a latency of 0.276 s/image (s.d. = 0.002) while consuming an average current of 1665.21 mA. Raspberry Pi consumed the least average current (838.99 mA) with a ten times worse latency of 2.83 s/image (s.d. = 0.036). Nano was the only reasonable option as an edge device because it could capture most animals whose maximum speeds were below 80 km/h, including goats, lions, ostriches, etc. While the proposed architecture is viable, unbalanced data remain a challenge and the results can potentially be improved by using object detection to reduce imbalances and by exploring semi-supervised learning. © 2022 by the authors.

We analyze the target comparison files in four different granularities, and implement the diffing by both top down process and bottom up process according to the granularities. The top down process aims to narrow the comparison scope, selecting the candidate functions that are likely to be similar according to the call relationship. Neural network model is applied in the bottom up process to vectorize the semantic features of candidate functions into matrices, and calculate the similarity score to obtain the corresponding relationship between functions to be compared. The bottom up process improves the comparison accuracy, while the top down process guarantees efficiency.

In this paper, we address the channel measurement for link reliability evaluation in filter-bank multicarrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation- (FBMC/OQAM-) based IoT network, which is considered as a promising technique for future wireless communications. However, resulting from the imaginary interference and the noise correlation among subcarriers in FBMC/OQAM, the existing frequency correlation method cannot be directly applied in the FBMC/OQAM-based IoT network. In this study, the concept of the block repetition is applied in FBMC/OQAM. It is demonstrated that the noises among subcarriers are independent by the block repetition and linear combination, instead of correlated. On this basis, the classical frequency correlation method can be applied to achieve the channel measurement. Then, we also propose an advanced frequency correlation method to improve the accuracy of the channel measurement, by assuming channel frequency responses to be quasi-invariant for several successive subcarriers.

Smart home automation and its application have received much progress towards convenience, comfort, safety, and home security. With the advances in technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), the home environment has witnessed an improved remote control of appliances, monitoring, and home security over the internet. Several home automation systems have been developed to monitor movements in the home and report to the user. Existing home automation systems detect motion and have surveillance for home security. However, the logical aspect of averting unnecessary or fake notifications is still a major area of challenge. Intelligent response and monitoring make smart home automation efficient. This work presents an intelligent home automation system for controlling home appliances, monitoring environmental factors, and detecting movement in the home and its surroundings. A deep learning model is proposed for motion recognition and classification based on the detected movement patterns. Using a deep learning model, an algorithm is developed to enhance the smart home automation system for intruder detection and forestall the occurrence of false alarms. A human detected by the surveillance camera is classified as an intruder or home occupant based on his walking pattern. The proposed method's prototype was implemented using an ESP32 camera for surveillance, a PIR motion sensor, an ESP8266 development board, a 5 V four-channel relay module, and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. The environmental conditions measured were evaluated using a mathematical model for the response time to effectively show the accuracy of the DHT sensor for weather monitoring and future prediction.

In this context, achieving service personalization requires collecting sensitive data about users. That yields to privacy concerns due to the possibility of abusing the data through unauthorized access. Moreover, IoT devices have limited computing resources, making them difficult to perform heavy protection mechanisms. Despite several existing solutions for privacy protection, they were not designed to run on limited resources in large scale environment. In addition, existing access control solutions, including XACML, are heavy to run on resource constraint devices and lack behavior-based customization of user privacy where users have little to no control over their private data.

The internet is smoothly changing from an internet of people towards an Internet of Things, which permits various objects to connect to another wirelessly. The energy consumption of the IoT routing protocol can affect the network life span. In addition, the high volume of data produced by IoT will result in transmission collision, security issues, and energy dissipation due to increased data redundancy because tiny sensors are usually hard to recharge after they are deployed. Generally, to save energy, data aggregation reduces data redundancy at each node by turning some nodes into sleep mode and others into wake mode. Therefore, it is important to group the nodes with high data similarity using the fuzzy matrix. Then, the data received from the member nodes at the Cluster Head (CH) are analyzed using a fuzzy similarity matrix for clustering. In the next step, after clustering, some nodes are chosen from all groups as redundant nodes. The sleep scheduling mechanism is then applied to reduce data redundancy, network traffic jamming, and transmission costs. We have proposed an Energy-Efficient Data Aggregation Mechanism (EEDAM) secured by blockchain, which uses a data aggregation mechanism at the cluster level to save energy. As edge computing is used to provide on-demand trusted services to IoT with minimum delay, blockchain is integrated inside a cloud server, so the edge is validated by the blockchain to provide secure services to IoT. Finally, we performed simulations to calculate the performance of the proposed mechanism and compared it with the conventional energy-efficient algorithms. The simulation results show that the proposed structural design can successfully reduce the amount of data, provide proper security to the IoT, and extend the wireless sensor network (WSN). © 2013 IEEE.","availability; blockchain; Edge computing; energy efficiency; IoT systems; security; wireless sensor networks","Availability; Blockchain; Cloud security; Computer architecture; Cost reduction; Data reduction; Edge computing; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Green computing; Internet of things; Matrix algebra; Network architecture; Network security; Power management (telecommunication); Redundancy; Sensor nodes; Structural design; Aggregation mechanism; Block-chain; Cloud-computing; Data aggregation; Edge computing; Internet of thing system; Security; Energy efficiency",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123737399

This paper proposes a general low-complex data sorting framework that distinguishes the sorted or similar data, makes independent subarrays approximately in equal length, and sorts the subarrays' data using one of the popular comparison-based sorting algorithms. Two frameworks, one for serial realization and another for parallel realization, are proposed. The time complexity analyses of the proposed framework demonstrate an improvement compared to the conventional Merge and Quick sorting algorithms. Following complexity analysis, the simulation results indicate slight improvements in the elapsed time and the number of swaps of the proposed serial Merge-based and Quick-based frameworks compared to the conventional ones for low/high variance integer/non-integer data sets, in different data sizes and the number of divisions. It is about (1-1.6%) to (3.5-4%) and (0.3-1.8%) to (2-4%) improvements in the elapsed times for 1, 2, 3, and 4 divisions, respectively for small and very large data sets in Merge-based and Quick-based scenarios. Although these improvements in serial realization are minor, making independent low-variance subarrays allows the sorted components to be extracted sequentially and gradually before the end of the sorting process. Also, it proposes a general framework for parallelizing conventional sorting algorithms using non-connected (independent) or connected (dependent) multi-core structures. As the second experiment, the numerical analyses that compare the results of the parallel realization of the proposed framework to the serial one in 1, 2, 3, and 4 divisions, show a speedup factor of (2-4) for small to (2-16) for very large data sets. The third experiment shows the effectiveness of the proposed parallel framework to the parallel sorting based on the random-access machine model. Finally, we prove that the mean-based pivot is as efficient as the median-based and much better than the random pivot for making subarrays of approximately equal length. © 2013 IEEE.","Data sorting; Gaussian; integer; merge; multi-core; non-integer; parallel realization; quick; Rayleigh; time and space complexity; uniform","Complex networks; Computational complexity; Data mining; Merging; Sorting; Array; Complexity theory; Data sorting; Gaussians; Integer; License; Merge; Multi-cores; Non-integer; Parallel realizations; Quick; Rayleigh; Time and space complexity; Time complexity; Uniform; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123731144

In the present work, we design a Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) with mobile gateways (GWs) installed on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. We address synchronization issues due to intermittent link availability between the End Devices (EDs) and the GW, and we propose a Scheduling Algorithm for LoRa to LEO Satellites (SALSA). SALSA ensures reliable communication, avoiding packets drops and packet collisions, by using a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) approach, rather than classic ALOHA-based LoRa. The uplink transmissions of the EDs are scheduled considering the satellite availability period, the satellite footprint, and the specific visit time for each ED. Two different policies are proposed: a First Come First Served (FCFS), and a FAIR policy. Simulation results, obtained in real conditions, with real satellites visibility, demonstrate the better performance achievable with SALSA (regardless of the policy) compared to standard LoRa. The FAIR policy outperforms the FCFS policy by giving all the EDs an equal chance to transmit, even to those that are visited last by the satellite. The performance of SALSA can be further improved considering larger constellations of LEO satellites. © 2013 IEEE.","fairness; Internet of Things; LoRaWAN; optimization methods; performance evaluation; Satellite communication; scheduling algorithm; synchronization","5G mobile communication systems; Communication satellites; Internet of things; Orbits; Scheduling algorithms; Time division multiple access; Wide area networks; Downlink; Fairness; Long range wide area network; Low earth orbit satellites; Optimization method; Performances evaluation; Satellite broadcasting; Satellite communications; Uplink; Wide-area networks; Satellite communication systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123713833

Recent advances in positioning technology have attracted significant interest for a diverse set of new applications in mmWave imaging. However, many use cases, such as automotive-mounted SAR imaging, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging, and freehand imaging with smartphones, are constrained to irregular scanning geometries. Whereas traditional near-field SAR imaging systems and quick personnel security (QPS) scanners employ highly precise motion controllers to create ideal synthetic arrays, emerging applications, mentioned previously, inherently cannot achieve such ideal positioning. In addition, many Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G applications impose strict size and computational complexity limitations that must be considered for edge mmWave imaging technology.

In this article, we address the issue of demand response of EVs during MG outages by leveraging Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. Particularly, we investigate an auction trading market that allows EVs with surplus energy to act as sellers, and EVs that want to be charged to act as buyers. A novel distributed double auction scheme is proposed to allow each buyer EV to submit multiple bids to seller EVs in different parking lots. Nonetheless, the locations of buyer EVs could be inferred by an adversary through analyzing the valuations, posing serious privacy and security risks. In this regard, a valuation-based attack scheme is investigated to validate the potential privacy risk. To defend against such an attack, we present a location privacy-preserving double auction scheme, in which the MicroGrid Central Controller (MGCC) acts as the auctioneer, solving the social welfare maximization problem of matching buyers to sellers, and the cloud is used to conduct calculations for the auctioneer, protecting the privacy of participants via homomorphic encryption. Theoretical analysis is conducted to validate our auction scheme in satisfying the designed economic and privacy properties (e.g., strategy-proofness and $k$k-anonymity). The experimental results show that our auction scheme can not only mitigate the demand response problem in MGs, but also provides good performance with respect to social welfare, satisfaction ratio, computational and communication overhead, and privacy leakage. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","cyber-physical system; double auction; electrical vehicles; Internet of Things; Security and privacy","Commerce; Cryptography; Cyber Physical System; Data privacy; Embedded systems; Location; Sales; Vehicles; Demand response; Double auction; Electrical vehicles; Location privacy; Microgrid; Parking lots; Privacy risks; Security and privacy; Surplus energy; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123608423

Data storage is overly dependent on third-party platforms leading to single-point failures. Besides, trust issues seriously affect users' willingness to participate and the credibility of data. To solve these two problems, a creditable and distributed incentive mechanism based on Hyperledger Fabric (HF-CDIM) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the HF-CDIM combines auction, reputation and data detection methods. First, we develop a multi-attribute auction algorithm with a reputation on blockchain by designing a smart contract, which achieves a distributed incentive mechanism for participants. Second, we propose a K-nearest neighbor outlier detection algorithm based on geographic location and similarity to quantify the credibility of the data. It is also used to update the user's reputation index. This guarantees the credibility of sensing data.

In pulse width modulation (PWM) and pulse frequency modulation (PFM) mode, adaptive on-time (AOT) V2 control is utilized to achieve seamless mode transition and constant switching frequency in PWM mode. A deep green mode (DGM) is proposed for light load, where both the switching loss and the power of control circuitry are minimized. By reducing the comparator current, a delay-based hysteresis window adaptive to load current is generated, reducing the switching frequency and the loss.

The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is one of the most important IoT applications. IoT supports AMI to collect data from smart sensors, analyse and measure abnormalities in the energy consumption pattern of sensors. However, two-way communication in distributed sensors is sensitive and tends towards security and privacy issues. Before deploying distributed sensors, data confidentiality and privacy and message authentication for sensor devices and control messages are the major security requirements. Several authentications and encryption protocols have been developed to provide confidentiality and integrity. However, many sensors in distributed systems, resource constraint smart sensors, and adaptability of IoT communication protocols in sensors necessitate designing an efficient and lightweight security authentication scheme. This paper proposes a Payload Encryption-based Optimisation Scheme for lightweight authentication (PEOS) on distributed sensors. The PEOS integrates and optimises important features of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) in Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) architecture instead of implementing the DTLS in a separate channel. The proposed work designs a payload encryption scheme and an Optimised Advanced Encryption Standard (OP-AES). The PEOS modifies the DTLS handshaking and retransmission processes in PEOS using payload encryption and NACK messages, respectively. It also removes the duplicate features of the protocol version and sequence number without impacting the performance of CoAP. Moreover, the PEOS attempts to improve the CoAP over distributed sensors in the aspect of optimised AES operations, such as parallel execution of S-boxes in SubBytes and delayed Mixcolumns. The efficiency of PEOS authentication is evaluated on Conitki OS using the Cooja simulator for lightweight security and authentication. The proposed scheme attains better throughput while minimising the message size overhead by 9% and 23% than the existing payload-based mutual authentication PbMA and basic DTLS/CoAP scheme in random network topologies with less than 50 nodes. © 2022 by the authors.

At first, a discussion is made on the characteristics of history course, which is combined with the characteristics of teaching data easy to collect under the background of IoT. An analysis is conducted on the related theory of educational data mining. Then, the concept of personalized recommendation is proposed based on deep learning (DL) algorithm. Finally, online and offline experiments are designed to verify the performance of the algorithm from review and investigation, smoothness, and participation of difficulty. The research results show that in terms of offline recommendation accuracy, the average record length in Math data set is 24.5, which is much smaller than that in range data set. The research has obvious innovation significance compared with other studies. In the process of target review and investigation, it is found that the research method here involves a wider range of knowledge and higher reliability. In terms of the difficulty of recommending questions, the Deep Reinforcement Exercise (DRE) recommendation algorithm can adaptively adjust the difficulty of recommending questions. It also allows students to set different learning goals through participation goals. But in the experiments on Math data set, Step 10's recommendation results are not very good, and the difficulty level varies greatly. If the goal setting is high, the problem recommended to students is too difficult, students may answer these questions wrongly, forcing the algorithm to adjust the difficulty adaptively. According to the above results, DRE recommendation algorithm can adapt to different learning needs and customize the recommendation results, thus opening up a new path for the teaching of western music history. Besides, the combination of DL algorithm and western music history teaching design can recommend learning materials, which is of great significance in the teaching of history courses. © 2022 Zongye Yang.

The detection rate for 7 of 10 different network attacks, primarily various types of floods, is higher than 90% and for 3 of them – mainly reconnaissance and keylogging activities with low intensity of the generated traffic, deviates between 57% and 68%.

The sensors measure an important operating-condition state variable, but their measurements are noisy, so estimates are imperfect. Sensors can improve their own estimates by soliciting estimates from other sensors. The choice of which sensors to communicate with (target) is challenging because sensors (1) are constrained in the number of sensors they can target and (2) only have partial knowledge of how other sensors operate-that is, they do not know others' underlying inference algorithms/models. We study the targeting problem, examine the evolution of interfirm sensor communication patterns, and explore what drives the patterns. Academic/practical relevance: Many industries are increasingly using sensors to drive improvements in key performance metrics (e.g., asset uptime) through better information on operating conditions. Sensors will communicate among themselves to improve estimation. This IoT vision will have a major impact on operations management (OM), and OM scholars need to develop and examine models and frameworks to better understand sensor interactions. Methodology: Analytic modeling combining decision-making, estimation, optimization, and learning is used. Results: We show that when selecting its target(s), each sensor needs to consider both the measurement quality of the other sensors and its level of familiarity with their inference models. We establish that the state of the environment plays a key role in mediating quality and familiarity. When sensor qualities are public, we show that each sensor eventually settles on a constant target set, but this long-run target set is sample-path dependent (i.e., dependent on past states) and varies by sensor. The long-run network, however, can be fully defined at time zero as a random directed graph, and hence, one can probabilistically predict it. This prediction can be made perfect (i.e., the network can be identified in a deterministic way) after observing the state values for a limited number of periods. When sensor qualities are private, our results reveal that sensors may not settle on a constant target set but the subset among which it cycles can still be stochastically predicted. Managerial implications: Our work allows managers to predict (and influence) the set of other firms with which their sensors will form information links. Analogous to a manufacturer mapping its supplier base to help manage supply continuity, our work enables a firm to map its sensor-based-information suppliers to help manage information continuity.

Further, the establishment of reliable security for IoT constrained devices is considered to be ongoing research due to several factors such as device cost, implementation area, power consumption, and so on. In addition to these factors, hardware security also poses major challenges like above mentioned; further Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) offer a promising solution for the authentication of IoT devices as they provide unique fingerprints for the underlying devices through their challenge-response pairs. However, PUFs are vulnerable to modelling attacks; in this research work, a lightweight hardware security framework is designed that provides the security for light edge devices. The proposed hardware security framework introduces the three-step optimized approach to offer a secure and reliable solution for IoT device authentication. The first step deals with the designing of SP-PUF, the second step deals with introducing obfuscation technique into the same, and the third step deals with introducing the authentication mechanism. A machine learning attack is designed to evaluate the model and the proposed model is evaluated considering the different stages. This research work is evaluated in two parts; the first part of the evaluation is carried out for the security mechanism through machine learning algorithm attack i.e., logistic regression, Neural Network, and SVM; further evaluation is carried out considering the PUF evaluation parameter as uniqueness and reliability.

The wireless systems that are battery-driven can easily reconfigure the existing devices and sensors efficiently in the manufacturing units without employing any cable for power operation as well as for communication. The wireless sensor-actuator networks that are based on IEEE 802.15.4 consumes significantly less power. These networks are designed and built cost-effectively by considering the capacity of battery and expense so that they can be employed for many applications. The application of a typical wireless Autonomous Scheduling and Distributed Graph Routing (DDSR) has illustrated the reliability of employing its basic approaches for almost ten years and it consists of the accurate plot for routing and time-slotted channel hopping therefore ensuring accurate low-power wireless communication in the processing site. Officially declared by the controversial statements associated with the government of Greek experiences fourth industrialization. There is a huge requirement for sensor nodes link via WSAN in the industrial site. Also, reduced computational complexity is one of the drawbacks faced by the existing standards of WSAN which is caused because of their highly centralized traffic management systems and thereby significantly improves the consistency and accessibility of network operations at the expense of optimization. This research work enables the study of efficient Wireless DGR network management and also introduces an alternative for DDSR by enabling the sensor nodes to determine their data traffic routes for the transmission of data. When compared to the above two physical routing protocols, the proposed technique can drastically improve the performance of a network, throughput, and energy consumption under various aspects. Energy harvesting (EH) plays a significant role in the implementation of large IoT devices. The requirement for subsequent employment of power sources is eliminated by the efficient approach of Energy Harvesting and thereby providing a relatively close-perpetual working environment for the network. The structural concept of routing protocols that are designed for the IoT applications which are based on the wireless sensor has been transformed into ""energy-harvesting-aware"" from the concept of ""energy-aware"" because of the development in the Energy harvesting techniques. The main objective of the research work is to propose a routing protocol that is energy-harvesting-aware for the various network of IoT in case of acoustic sources of energy. A novel algorithm for routing called Autonomous Scheduling and Distributed Graph Routing (DDSR) has been developed and significantly improved by incorporating a new “energy back-off” factor. The proposed algorithm when integrated with various techniques of energy harvesting enhances the longevity of nodes, quality of service of a network under increased differential traffic, and factors influencing the accessibility of energy. The research work analyses the performance of the system for various constraints of energy harvesting. When compared to previous routing protocols the proposed algorithm achieves very good energy efficiency in the network of distributed IoT by fulfilling the requirements of QoS. © 2022, North Atlantic University Union NAUN.

Meanwhile, the concept of IoT (Internet of Things) is gaining momentum. Many IoT OSes, specialized to provide the large software stack required by IoT applications, have been released. Nevertheless, neither reliable RTOS nor IoT OS can satisfy all the requirements of IoT-enabled reliable systems. Dual-OS configuration (i.e. the coexistence of reliable RTOS and IoT OS) is a promising approach to achieve high reliability and productivity simultaneously. Existing dual-OS solutions, however, depend on additional hardware features (e.g. virtualization extensions, ARM TrustZone), which are unavailable in most resource-constrained devices. This paper presents iSotEE (iSolated Execution Environment), a middleware allowing IoT OS to run inside an isolated environment on top of a reliable RTOS without special hardware. Open-source implementations of iSotEE for Renesas RX (with TOPPERS/HRP3 as reliable RTOS, Amazon FreeRTOS as IoT OS) and ARMv7-M (with two configurations of Zephyr as reliable RTOS and IoT OS) architectures are provided and evaluated.

Moreover, many IoT devices incorporate a manufacturer-owned cloud-based back-end support to process and store the generated data while simultaneously sharing with third parties. Clearly, in such an industry-driven environment with the desire to use the IoT data as a revenue stream, it is a challenge for users to control IoT data. Device manufacturers utilize an opaque software design where user data is generated and stored with little transparency. Manufacturers use EULAs as a legal construct to protect a manufacturer's legal standing and to explain a device's behavior, however this explanation is vague and lacks the necessary details for a user to determine a device's acceptable use and it has become increasingly difficult for users to secure and maintain their data. Fortunately, as the privacy minded user base of IoT devices grows, the manufacturers will be forced to implement a new framework that can enable users to have more control on the creation of their IoT data, and to store/disseminate such data in a secure and private manner. In this paper, we address this lack of transparency from manufacturers and address the issues of privacy and security by proposing a new framework called Bulwark, for manufacturer use on IoT devices and mobile applications. Proposed framework enables the user to generate and manage a set of data controlling rules, and store the result in their personal cloud account, while providing a dashboard data reporting tool enabling data transparency and supporting good user choices. The user's ability to access, disseminate and secure IoT generated data, is now available within our proposed framework. Using reverse engineering, simulation and implementation of open source solutions, we demonstrate support for a set of common devices. Each device executed the framework, while communicating with a mobile application and cloud services. Rules were generated for each message and telemetry was returned to the mobile application for dashboard rendering. We stored generated data in the cloud using our own account, while maintaining the free tier for each of the cloud services. Network usage increased between 4% and 9% while storage size grew between 0% and 2% larger, as compared to using the device without the framework. Our framework demonstrates support for a multitude of devices, by either open source or support for similar feature sets. This framework is easy to integrate and we anticipate wide spread adoption. © 2013 IEEE.","cloud computing; IoT privacy; IoT security","Cloud computing; Cloud data security; Data privacy; Digital storage; Distributed database systems; Manufacture; Mobile computing; Open source software; Reverse engineering; Software design; Transparency; Web services; Cloud services; Cloud-based; Cloud-computing; Explosive growth; Internet of thing privacy; Internet of thing security; Large datasets; Mobile applications; Privacy and security; Software frameworks; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123366096

This article combines wireless powered communication (WPC) technology with an MEC network, where a base station (BS) can transfer wireless energy to edge users (EUs) and execute computation-intensive tasks through task offloading. Traditional numerical optimization methods are time-consuming approaches for solving this problem in time-varying wireless channels, and centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is not stable in large-scale dynamic IoT networks. Therefore, we propose a federated DRL-based online task offloading and resource allocation (FDOR) algorithm. In this algorithm, DRL is executed in EUs, and federated learning (FL) uses the distributed architecture of MEC to aggregate and update the parameters. To further solve the problem of the non-IID data of mobile EUs, we devise an adaptive method that automatically adjusts the FDOR algorithm's learning rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FDOR algorithm is superior to the traditional numerical optimization method and the existing DRL algorithm in four aspects: convergence speed, execution delay, overall calculation rate and stability in large-scale and dynamic IoT. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Motivated by these benefits, this research aims to design a lightweight autoencoder deep model that has a shallow architecture with a small number of input features and a few hidden neurons. To achieve this objective, an efficient two-layer optimizer is used to evolve a lightweight deep autoencoder model by performing simultaneous selection for the input features, the training instances, and the number of hidden neurons. The optimized deep model is constructed guided by both the accuracy of a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and the complexity of the autoencoder model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed optimized model, it has been applied for the N-baiot intrusion detection dataset. Reported results showed that the proposed model achieved anomaly detection accuracy of 99%with a lightweight autoencoder model with on average input features around 30 and output hidden neurons of 2 only.

However, false alarms can lead to alert overload, causing healthcare workers to miss critical occurrences that could be harmful or even fatal. The purpose of this work is to tackle the problem by developing an integrated system that can continually track the patient's health condition utilising a cloud computing platform, allowing alerts to be targeted to the appropriate medical facility personnel in a timely and orderly manner. Arduino microcontrollers are used to collect health parameters such as temperature and pulse rate and provide a real-time monitoring system for medical practitioners. Multiple sensors and an RF transceiver are attached to a small microcontroller, forming a wearable module that the patient will wear. This wearable component is wirelessly connected to the main module consisting of a larger microcontroller, where the data is then uploaded to the database in the cloud through the internet. The data can then be accessed through a web-based terminal, providing medical practitioners access through the web page. If the system detects any abrupt changes to the patient's temperature or pulse rate, a push notification will be sent to the medical practitioner's Android smartphone so that immediate action can be taken. The system is scalable as multiple wearable modules can be connected to the main module, allowing monitoring of multiple patients simultaneously. More sensors can also easily be added to the wearable module to monitor other vital health parameters such as oxygen saturation and blood pressure. The testing has indicated that the system can achieve 99.4% accuracy in temperature monitoring and 86% accuracy for pulse monitoring. © 2021 Wydawnictwo SIGMA-NOT.

F-RAN facilitates collaborative solutions while reducing delay by pushing the network capabilities beyond the edge. By leveraging diversity, RRHs may cooperate through silencing, reducing interference, or joint transmission strategies such as maximal ratio transmission. We derive closed-form outage probability expressions and attain their diversity gain. We validate the derived analytical results through extensive numerical simulations. Furthermore, we propose a mini-slots-based scheduling framework to serve URLLC users within their fixed latency budget. In an interference-limited regime with the proposed scheduling framework, we show that a performance gain is superior when RRHs cooperate compared to when they do not.

Although privacy-preserving data mining has been widely studied during the last decade, little attention has been paid to data values containing errors. Differential privacy, which is the de facto standard privacy metric, can be achieved by adding noise to a target value that must be protected. However, if the target value already contains errors, there is no reason to add extra noise. In this paper, a novel privacy model called true-value-based differential privacy (TDP) is proposed. This model applies traditional differential privacy to the “true value” unknown by the data owner or anonymizer but not to the “measured value” containing errors. Based on TDP, the amount of noise added by differential privacy techniques can be reduced by approximately 20% by our solution. As a result, the error of generated histograms can be reduced by 40.4% and 29.6% on average according to mean square error and Jensen–Shannon divergence, respectively. We validate this result on synthetic and five real data sets. Moreover, we proved that the privacy protection level does not decrease as long as the measurement error is not overestimated.

There are several IoT platforms that offer several capabilities for the development of these systems. Some of these platforms are Google Cloud's IoT Platform, Microsoft Azure IoT suite, ThingSpeak IoT Platform, Thingworx 8 IoT Platform or FIWARE. However, they are complex IoT platforms where each IoT solution has to be developed ad-hoc and implemented by developers by hand. Consequently, developing IoT solutions is a hard, error-prone and tedious task. Thus, increase the abstraction level from which the IoT systems are designed helps to tackle the underlying technology complexity. In this sense, model-driven development approaches can help to both reduce the IoT application time to market and tackle the technological complexity to develop IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a Domain-Specific Language based on SimulateIoT for the design, code generation and simulation of IoT systems which could be deployed on FIWARE infrastructure (an open-source IoT platform). This implies not only designing the IoT system for a high abstraction level and later on code generation, but also designing and deploying an additional simulation layer to simulate the system on the FIWARE infrastructure before final deployment. The FIWARE IoT environment generated includes the sensors, actuators, fog nodes, cloud nodes and analytical characteristics, which are deployed as microservices on Docker containers and composed suitability to obtain a service-oriented architecture. Finally, two case studies focused on a smart building and an agricultural IoT environment are presented to show the IoT solutions deployed using FIWARE.

Since detected objects under surveillance are usually low-resolution and noisy, their accurate recognition represents a huge challenge. Knowledge distillation is an effective method to deal with it, but existing related work usually focuses on reducing the channel count of a student network, not feature map size. As a result, they cannot transfer -privilege information hidden in feature maps of a wide and deep teacher network into a thin and shallow student one, leading to the latter's poor performance. To address this issue, we propose a Feature Map Distillation (FMD) framework under which the feature map size of teacher and student networks is different. FMD consists of two main components: Feature Decoder Distillation (FDD) and Feature Map Consistency-enforcement (FMC). FDD reconstructs the shallow texture features of a thin student network to approximate the corresponding samples in a teacher network, which allows the high-resolution ones to directly guide the learning of the shallow features of the student network. FMC makes the size and direction of each deep feature map consistent between student and teacher networks, which constrains each pair of feature maps to produce the same feature distribution. FDD and FMC allow a thin student network to learn rich -privilege information in feature maps of a wide teacher network. The overall performance of FMD is verified in multiple recognition tasks by comparing it with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods on low-resolution and noisy objects. 1941-0042 © 2022 IEEE.

IoT requires a better communication network for data transmission between heterogeneous devices and an optimally deployed energy-efficient WSN. The clustering technique applied for WSN node deployment needs to be efficient; therefore, the entire architecture can obtain a better network lifetime. While clustering, the entire network is partitioned into various clusters. Moreover, the cluster head (CH) selection process also needs proper attention for achieving efficient data communication towards the sink node via selected CH and also for increasing the node reachability within the cluster. In this proposed framework, an energy efficient deep belief network (DBN) based routing protocol is developed, which achieves better data transmission through the selected path. Due to this the packet delivery ratio (PDR) gets improved. In this framework, initially, the nodes in the whole network is grouped as clusters using a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, which assigns a reward for the nodes that belong to the particular cluster. Then, the CH required for efficient data communication is selected using a Mantaray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) algorithm. The data is transmitted to the sink node via the selected CH using an efficient deep learning approach. At last, the performance of proposed deep network based routing protocol is evaluated using different evaluation metrics they are network lifetime, energy consumption, number of alive nodes, and packet delivery rate. Finally, the evaluated results are compared with few existing algorithms. Among all these algorithms, the proposed DBN routing protocol has achieved better network lifetime. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a new era of digital communication and has a rising demand for intelligent devices and applications. It faces performance deterioration and quality of service (QoS) degradation problems, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) based scenarios. Therefore, existing caching strategies need to be enhanced to augment the cache hit ratio and manage the limited storage to accelerate content deliveries. Alternatively, quantum computing (QC) appears to be a prospect of more or less every typical computing problem. The framework is basically a merger of a deep learning (DL) agent deployed at the network edge with a quantum memory module (QMM). Firstly, the DL agent prioritizes caching contents via self organizing maps (SOMs) algorithm, and secondly, the prioritized contents are stored in QMM using a Two-Level Spin Quantum Phenomenon (TLSQP). After selecting the most appropriate lattice map (32 × 32) in 750,000 iterations using SOMs, the data points below the dark blue region are mapped onto the data frame to get the videos. These videos are considered a high priority for trending according to the input parameters provided in the dataset. Similarly, the light-blue color region is also mapped to get medium-prioritized content. After the SOMs algorithm's training, the topographic error (TE) value together with quantization error (QE) value (i.e., 0.0000235) plotted the most appropriate map after 750,000 iterations. In addition, the power of QC is due to the inherent quantum parallelism (QP) associated with the superposition and entanglement principles. A quantum computer taking ""n""qubits that can be stored and execute 2n presumable combinations of qubits simultaneously reduces the utilization of resources compared to conventional computing. It can be analyzed that the cache hit ratio will be improved by ranking the content, removing redundant and least important content, storing the content having high and medium prioritization using QP efficiently, and delivering precise results. The experiments for content prioritization are conducted using Google Colab, and IBM's Quantum Experience is considered to simulate the quantum phenomena. © 2022 Tayyabah Hasan et al.",,"Deep learning; Deterioration; Digital devices; Digital storage; Edge computing; Fog; Fog computing; Internet of things; Quality of service; Quantum entanglement; Quantum interference phenomena; Self organizing maps; Wireless sensor networks; Cache hit ratio; Error values; Learning agents; Memory modules; Quantum Computing; Quantum memory; Quantum parallelism; Quantum phenomena; Self Organizing Map algorithm; Sensors network; Conformal mapping; algorithm; computer analysis; female; human; pregnancy; quantum theory; Algorithms; Computing Methodologies; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Quantum Theory",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123234704

Evolving 5G-IoT scenarios and basic services like reality augmented, high dense streaming of videos, unmanned vehicles, e-health, and intelligent environments services have a pervasive existence now. These services generate heavy loads and need high capacity, bandwidth, data rate, throughput, and low latency. Taking all these requirements into consideration, internet of things (IoT) networks have provided global transformation in the context of big data innovation and bring many problematic issues in terms of uplink and downlink (DL) connectivity and traffic load. These comprise coordinated multipoint processing (CoMP), carriers' aggregation (CA), joint transmissions (JTs), massive multi-inputs multi-outputs (MIMO), machine-type communications, centralized radios access networks (CRAN), and many others. CoMP is one of the most significant technical enhancements added to release 11 that can be implemented in heterogonous networks implementation approaches and the homogenous networks' topologies. However, in a massive 5G-IoT device scenario with heavy traffic load, most cell edge IoT users are severely suffering from intercell interference (ICI), where the users have poor signal, lower data rates, and limited QoS. This work is aimed at addressing this problematic issue by proposing two types of DL-JT-CoMP techniques in 5G-IoT that are compliant with release 18. Downlink JT-CoMP with two homogeneous network CoMP deployment scenarios is considered and evaluated. The scenarios used are IoT intrasite and intersite CoMP, which performance evaluated using downlink system-level simulator for long-term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) and 5G. Numerical simulation scenarios were results under high dense scenario - with IoT heavy traffic load which shows that intersite CoMP has better empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of average UE throughput than intrasite CoMP approximately 4%, inter-site CoMP has better ECDF of average user entity (UE) spectral efficiency than intrasite CoMP almost 10%, and intersite CoMP has approximately same ECDF of average signal interference noise ratio (SINR) as intrasite CoMP and intersite CoMP has better fairness index than intrasite CoMP by 5%.

In the face of large-scale data processing and calculations, traditional cloud computing is facing tremendous pressure, and the demand for new low-latency computing technologies is imminent. As a supplementary expansion of cloud computing technology, mobile edge computing will sink the computing power from the previous cloud to a network edge node. Through the mutual cooperation between computing nodes, the number of nodes that can be calculated is more, the types are more comprehensive, and the computing range is even greater. Broadly, it makes up for the shortcomings of cloud computing technology.

Therefore, edge IoT nodes are more susceptible to various security attacks. To this end, a lightweight mutual authentication and key agreement protocol is proposed to achieve the security of IoT nodes' communication. The protocol uses the reverse fuzzy extractor to acclimatize to the noisy environment and introduces the supplementary subprotocol to enhance resistance to the desynchronization attack. It uses only lightweight cryptographic operations, such as hash function, XORs, and PUF. It only stores one pseudo-identity.

Urban renewal is a very complex project. The renewal and expansion of most cities in the country usually involve demolishing and rebuilding. This way of urban renewal only pays attention to the renewal efficiency of cities and towns, and ignores the health needs of residents, which will make community residents lack a sense of security, pleasure, comfort, and belonging to the community, and greatly reduce the quality of life and physical fitness of community residents. Building a healthy city is an important goal of today's society, and community is the basic unit of a city, so it is urgent to build a health-promoting community. We should pay attention to and study the social environment, the external space environment of residential areas, and the interaction between them, so as to make develop them in a healthy direction and create a healthy and positive community. Therefore, it is an urgent task to improve the community residents' attention to the above problems and build community outdoor space, which has very important practical significance. In this paper, we use the cloud resource scheduling mechanism and the Internet of things to study the healthy role of community outdoor space planning. Through the transplantation of embedded Linux system, the development of communication interface and the external acquisition sensing device, we collect the information of working status and running status, and transmit it to the database built in the cloud through the 4G module on the motherboard. Then, HTML + java script + CSS + JSON + Ajax technology is used to write the display interface and logical relationship, so that the data can be displayed on the mobile terminal and PC, which can provide a useful technical exploration for outdoor space planning. The community Internet of Things technology realizes the intelligent community environment detection, and the community cloud resource scheduling mechanism combined with the community Internet of Things can obtain the residents' help information in time and allocate the community outdoor resources in real time, which can not only meet the health needs of community members but also be conducive to the sustainable development of a health-promoting community.

Smart healthcare uses a new generation of information technologies, such as the Internet of Things (loT), big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, to transform the traditional medical system in an all-around way, making healthcare more efficient, more convenient, and more personalized. miRNAs can regulate the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of human cells. Relevant studies have also shown that miRNAs may play a key role in the occurrence and development of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI). This study aims to explore the effects of miR-489 in MIRI. In this study, miR-489 expression in a myocardial ischemia-reperfusion animal model and H9C2 cells induced by H/R was detected by qRT-PCR. The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the activity of creatine kinase (CK) was detected after miR-489 knockdown in H9C2 cells induced by H/R. The apoptosis of H9C2 cells and animal models were determined by ELISA. The relationship between miR-489 and SPIN1 was verified by a double fluorescence reporter enzyme assay. The expression of the PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins was detected by Western blot. Experimental results showed that miR-489 was highly expressed in cardiac muscle cells of the animal model and in H9C2 cells induced by H/R of the myocardial infarction group, which was positively associated with the apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells with ischemia-reperfusion. miR-489 knockdown can reduce the apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells caused by ischemia-reperfusion. In downstream targeting studies, it was found that miR-489 promotes the apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells after ischemia-reperfusion by targeting the inhibition of the SPIN1-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway. In conclusion, high expression of miR-489 is associated with increased apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells after ischemia-reperfusion, which can promote the apoptosis after ischemia-reperfusion by targeting the inhibition of the SPIN1-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore, miR-489 can be one of the potential therapeutic targets for reducing the apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells after ischemia-reperfusion. © 2022 Wenhua Li et al.",,"Animals; Cell death; Enzymes; Health care; Heart; Muscle; Animal model; Cardiac muscles; Cloud-computing; Data clouds; H9c2 cells; Ischaemia-reperfusion; Medical systems; Muscle cell; Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion; Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injuries; RNA; biological marker; creatine kinase; cyt c protein; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; lactate dehydrogenase; microRNA; microRNA 489; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein; protein Bax; protein kinase B; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; artificial intelligence; big data; cardiac muscle cell; cloud computing; controlled study; creatine kinase blood level; double fluorescence reporter enzyme assay; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene amplification; gene control; gene knockdown; genetic transfection; H9c2(2-1) cell line; health care system; heart tissue; internet of things; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; medical technology; myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury; nonhuman; pathogenesis; Pi3K/Akt signaling; protein expression; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; Western blotting",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123052684

As a promising solution to this problem, opportunistic FNs (OFNs) which denote FNs with mobility such as smart phones and vehicles have been considered as they opportunistically reduce the load of static FNs.

These technologies must ultimately be brought directly to the edge to fully harness the power of deep leaning for the IoT. The obvious challenge is that deep learning techniques can only be implemented on strictly resource-constrained edge devices if the models are radically downsized. This task relies on different model compression techniques, such as network pruning, quantization, and the recent advancement of XNOR-Net. This study examines the suitability of these techniques for audio classification on microcontrollers. We present an application of XNOR-Net for end-to-end raw audio classification and a comprehensive empirical study comparing this approach with pruning-and-quantization methods. We show that raw audio classification with XNOR yields comparable performance to regular full precision networks for small numbers of classes while reducing memory requirements 32-fold and computation requirements 58-fold. However, as the number of classes increases significantly, performance degrades, and pruning-and-quantization based compression techniques take over as the preferred technique being able to satisfy the same space constraints but requiring approximately 8x more computation. We show that these insights are consistent between raw audio classification and image classification using standard benchmark sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply XNOR to end-to-end audio classification and evaluate it in the context of alternative techniques.

Their main benefits include adaptability, configuration, and flexibility, with added efficiency in cost and transmission time. Traffic prediction refers to forecasting the traffic volumes in a network. The traffic volume includes incoming requests and outgoing data transmitted by the network nodes. The previous logs of traffic in the network are used for extracting patterns that help for accurate predictions. In this paper, an analysis of various existing traffic prediction methods is done. Specifically, the analysis of a case study where the performance of the High-Speed Diesel (HSD) pump is predicted by observing its output. A network of sensors form a less mesh network; sensors act as nodes while reading the parameters, namely, three-phase Current, Voltage, Temperature, and Vibration. In this case study, a High-Speed Diesel pumps' performance is predicted by predicting the vibration parameter as the output parameter. Other parameters affecting the performance of the High-Speed Diesel pump which are causing the change in vibration value are identified. Various algorithms, including Statistical Auto-Regressive Integration and Moving Average, Poisson's regression, and a few Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms like Decision Tree Regressor, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Linear Regression, and Long Short-Term Memory are implemented and evaluated for this purpose. Along with the comparison, a novel architecture using Convolution Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory is described in this paper. The result and comparison between these give the clear understanding that the suggested novel Convo-LSTM model gives better performance and helps to predict the performance of the High-Speed Diesel pump. The proposed system makes a strong case for the network traffic prediction, where the use of historical data is collected over the wireless mesh network.

Some IoT protocols share the same bandwidth leading to interference on neighboring networks and decrease of overall coverage. To contribute to this problem, an analytical study of the coverage of a LoRa network with underlying uncoordinated IoT networks for uplink transmissions is presented in this paper. Using stochastic geometry, closed form analytical expressions are proposed allowing to analyze the success and coverage probabilities for a LoRa network. An appropriate model of the path loss including real-life values is used to characterize the log-distance propagation parameters.

IoT technology incorporates several tasks to achieve the goals for which it was developed through smart services. These services are intelligent activities that allow devices to interact with the physical world to provide suitable services to users anytime and anywhere. However, the remarkable advancement of this technology has increased the number and the mechanisms of attacks. Attackers often take advantage of the IoTs’ heterogeneity to cause trust problems and manipulate the behavior to delude devices’ reliability and the service provided through it. Consequently, trust is one of the security challenges that threatens IoT smart services. Trust management techniques have been widely used to identify untrusted behavior and isolate untrusted objects over the past few years. However, these techniques still have many limitations like ineffectiveness when dealing with a large amount of data and continuously changing behaviors. Therefore, this paper proposes a model for trust management in IoT devices and services based on the simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm. The SMART is used for calculating the trust value, while LSTM is used for identifying changes in the behavior based on the trust threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using accuracy, loss rate, precision, recall, and F-measure on different data samples with different sizes. Comparisons with existing deep learning and machine learning models show superior performance with a different number of iterations. With 100 iterations, the proposed model achieved 99.87% and 99.76% of accuracy and F-measure, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.

In this study, we adopt cooperative bargaining theory to design our PEC resource allocation scheme. According to the concept of unification bargaining solution, different bargaining ideas are reciprocally combined to provide a fair-efficient solution. By coordinating network agents, we can leverage mutual consensus and approximate a well-balanced system performance among conflicting requirements. It is essential to explore the relevant trade-off between efficiency and fairness. To effectively share the PEC resources, the main novelty of our approach is its adaptability and flexibility to respond dynamic PEC system environments.

Edge computing has improved user quality of service (QoS) guarantees through the reduced geographical distance, decreased use of the network backbone, and flexible placement of the container hosting edge devices. The under-utilized isolated edge computing idling nodes are significant for service providers, especially for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the nodes' minimal maintenance remains a hindrance due to related increased failures. Orchestrating over the edge alongside core environments allows tolerant services and more demanding ones to coexist without impacting the user experience. Therefore, the orchestrator's second priority is achieving and maintaining the QoS through optimal recovery method selection by either migrating the live containers or re-instantiating them. This paper proposes an Optimal Container Migration/Re-Instantiation (OC-MRI) model to optimize the orchestration methods focusing on downtime, container dependencies, and latency requirements. Next, we introduce a real-time heuristic-based solution, Edge Computing-enabled Container Migration/Re-Instantiation (EC2-MRI). Both models are bench-marked alongside staple greedy approaches. Simulation results showcase the lowest latencies and downtime with the OC-MRI model. Furthermore, the EC2-MRI model shows comparable results to the optimal model with minimal lag. © 2020 IEEE.","hybrid computing; integer programming; migration/re-instantiation","Edge computing; Integer programming; Internet of things; Internet service providers; Maintenance; Quality of service; Cloud-computing; Computational modelling; Container orchestration; Delay; Edge computing; Hybrid computing; Integer Program- ming; Migration/re-instantiation.; Optimisations; Quality-of-service; Containers",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122886278

Therefore, a novel mode-based hash chain for secure mutual authentication is necessary to address the Internet of Things (IoT) devices’ vulnerability, as there have been several years of growing concerns regarding their security. Therefore, a novel model is designed that is stronger and effective against any kind of unauthorized attack, as IoT devices’ vulnerability is on the rise due to the mass production of IoT devices (embedded processors, camera, sensors, etc.), which ignore the basic security requirements (passwords, secure communication), making them vulnerable and easily accessible. Furthermore, crackable passwords indicate that the security measures taken are insufficient. As per the recent studies, several applications regarding its requirements are the IoT distributed denial of service attack (IDDOS), micro-cloud, secure university, Secure Industry 4.0, secure government, secure country, etc. The problem statement is formulated as the “design and implementation of dynamically interconnecting fog servers and edge devices using the mode-based hash chain for secure mutual authentication protocol”, which is stated to be an NP-complete problem. The hash-chain fog/edge implementation using timestamps, mode-based hash chaining, the zero-knowledge proof property, a distributed database/blockchain, and cryptography techniques can be utilized to establish the connection of smart devices in large numbers securely. The hash-chain fog/edge uses blockchain for identity management only, which is used to store the public keys in distributed ledger form, and all these keys are immutable. In addition, it has no overhead and is highly secure as it performs fewer calculations and requires minimum infrastructure. Therefore, we designed the hash-chain fog/edge (HCFE) protocol, which provides a novel mutual authentication scheme for effective session key agreement (using ZKP properties) with secure protocol communications. The experiment outcomes proved that the hash-chain fog/edge is more efficient at interconnecting various devices and competed favorably in the benchmark comparison. © 2022 by the authors.

The amplitude modulation of the second-harmonic output signal is achieved by driving a low-frequency MOSFET, which modifies the dc impedance termination of the doubler. Since the modulation signal is applied to the gate port of the transistor, no static current is drained. A proof-of-concept prototype was manufactured and tested, operating at 1.04 GHz. An on/off ratio of 23 dB was observed in the conversion loss of the doubler for an available input power of −10 dBm. The modulation port of the circuit was excited with a square wave ( fm up to 15 MHz), and the measured sidebands in the spectrum featured a good agreement with the theory. Then, the doubler was connected to a harmonic antenna system and tested in a wireless experiment for fm up to 1 MHz, showing an excellent performance. Finally, an experiment was conducted where the output signal of the doubler was modulated by a reed switch used to measure the rotational speed of an electrical motor.

In addition to these, the use of intelligent data-analysis techniques, such as black-box artificial neural networks (ANNs), is receiving research attention with the aim of designing building thermal-behavior models from collected data.

Accordingly, the aim of this research was to identify and analyze the barriers impeding the use of such technologies in the CSSM context. To this end, initially, the extant literature was reviewed extensively and nine experts were interviewed, which led to the identification of 18 barriers. Then, the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) was used to calculate the importance weights of the identified barriers and prioritize them through the lenses of competent experts in Hong Kong. Following this, the findings were validated using semi-structured interviews. The findings showed that the barriers related to “productivity reduction due to wearable sensors”, “the need for technical training”, and “the need for continuous monitoring” were the most significant, while “limitations on hardware and software and lack of standardization in efforts,” “the need for proper light for smooth functionality”, and “safety hazards” were the least important barriers.

The Swarm Computing paradigm considers a single abstraction layer that connects all kinds of devices globally, from sensors to super computers. In this context, the Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) emerges, spreading out connection to the IoT end devices. With the upsides of long-range, low power and low cost, LPWAN presents major limitations regarding data transmission capacity, throughput, supported packet length and quantity per day limitation. This situation makes LPWAN systems with limited interoperability integrate with systems based on REpresentational State Transfer (REST). This work investigates how to connect web-based IoT applications with LPWANs. The analysis was carried out studying the number of packets generated for a use case of REST-based IoT over LPWAN, specifically the Swarm OS over LoRaWAN. The work also presents an analysis of the impact of using promising schemes for lower communication load. We evaluated Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) and Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) to make transmission over the restricted links of LPWANs possible.

In this study, a Hutchinson hypervolume is defined with temperature, humidity, air pressure, precipitation, and cloud cover climate vectors collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that were matched to mosquito presence and absence points extracted from NASA’s citizen science platform called GLOBE Observer and the National Ecological Observatory Network. An 86% accurate Random Forest model that operates on binary classification was created to predict mosquito threat. Given a location and date input, the model produces a threat level based on the number of decision trees that vote for a presence label. The feature importance chart and regression show a positive, linear correlation between humidity and mosquito threat and between temperature and mosquito threat below a threshold of 28◦ C. In accordance with the statistical analysis and ecological wisdom, high threat clusters in warm, humid regions and low threat clusters in cold, dry regions were found. With the model running on the cloud and within ArcGIS Dashboard, accurate and granular real-time threat level predictions can be made at any latitude and longitude. A device leveraging Global Positioning System (GPS) smartphone technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) to collect and analyze data on the edge was developed. The data from the edge device along with its respective date and location collected are automatically inputted into the aforementioned Random Forest model to provide users with a real-time threat level prediction.

Early detection and treatment of rice leaf infection are critical for promoting healthy rice plant growth and ensuring adequate supply for the fast-growing population. Computer-assisted rice leaf disease diagnoses are hampered due to strong image backgrounds. Popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture extracts the features from images and diagnoses the disease to address the issues above. However, this method is best suitable for segmented images and gives low accuracy with real-time images. In this case, the Internet of Things is a paradigm shift that collects agro-meteorological information that effectively helps diagnose rice diseases. Motivated by the usefulness of CNN models and agricultural IoT, a novel multimodal data fusion framework named Rice-Fusion is proposed to diagnose rice disease. Rice disease diagnosis based on a single modality may not be accurate, and hence the fusion of heterogeneous modalities is essential for robust and reliable disease diagnosis. This gives a new dimension to the domain of rice disease diagnosis. The dataset was collected manually with 3200 rice health category samples using two modalities, namely agro-meteorological sensors and a camera. The Rice-Fusion framework initially extracts the numerical features from agro-meteorological data collected from sensors. Next, it extracts the visual features from the captured rice images. These extracted features are further fused using a concatenation layer followed by a dense layer, which provides single output for diagnosing the rice disease. The testing accuracy of Rice-Fusion is 95.31% as opposed to other unimodal framework accuracies of 82.03% and 91.25% based on CNN and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures, respectively. Experimental results analysis demonstrates that the proposed Rice-Fusion multimodal data fusion framework outperforms the outcome of unimodal frameworks. © 2021 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; multi-layer perceptron; multimodal data fusion; Rice disease diagnosis; rice-fusion","Convolution; Diagnosis; Internet of things; Meteorology; Network architecture; Neural networks; Population statistics; Convolutional neural network; Disease diagnosis; Features extraction; Multi-modality; Multilayers perceptrons; Multimodal data fusion; Rice disease diagnose; Rice leaves; Rice-fusion; Unimodal; Data integration",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122849601

As a result of this, an efficient intrusion detection system for MQTT-based applications is still a missing piece of the IoT security context. Unfortunately, existing IDSs do not provide IoT communication protocol support such as MQTT or CoAP to validate crafted or malformed packets for protecting the protocol implementation vulnerabilities of IoT devices.

Edge is identical to Fog, except its positioning in the end devices is much nearer to end-users, making it process and respond to clients in less time. Further, it aids sensor networks, real-time streaming apps, and the IoT, all of which require high-speed and dependable internet access. For such an IoT system, Resource Scheduling Process (RSP) seems to be one of the most important tasks. This paper presents a RSP for Edge Computing (EC). The resource characteristics are first standardized and normalized. Next, for task scheduling, a Fuzzy Control based Edge Resource Scheduling (FCERS) is suggested. The results demonstrate that this technique enhances resource scheduling efficiency in EC and Quality of Service (QoS). The experimental study revealed that the suggested FCERS method in this work converges quicker than the other methods. Our method reduces the total computing cost, execution time, and energy consumption on average compared to the baseline. The ES allocates higher processing resources to each user in case of limited availability of MDs; this results in improved task execution time and a reduced total task computation cost.

The core concept behind MCS is to use the power of mobile sensors to accomplish a difficult task collaboratively, with each mobile user completing much simpler micro-tasks. This paper discusses the task assignment problem in mobile crowdsensing, which is dependent on sensing time and path planning with the constraints of participant travel distance budgets and sensing time intervals. The goal is to minimize aggregate sensing time for mobile users, which reduces energy consumption to encourage more participants to engage in sensing activities and maximize total task quality. This paper introduces a two-phase task assignment framework called location time-based algorithm (LTBA). LTBA is a framework that enhances task assignment in MCS, whereas assigning tasks requires overlapping time intervals between tasks and mobile users' tasks and the location of tasks and mobile users' paths. The process of assigning the nearest task to the mobile user's current path depends on the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) and Euclidean distance. LTBA combines two algorithms: (1) greedy online allocation algorithm and (2) bio-inspired travel-distance-balance-based algorithm (B-DBA). The greedy algorithm was sensing time interval-based and worked on reducing the overall sensing time of the mobile user. B-DBA was location-based and worked on maximizing total task quality. The results demonstrate that the average task quality is 0.8158, 0.7093, and 0.7733 for LTBA, B-DBA, and greedy, respectively. The sensing time was reduced to 644, 1782, and 685 time units for LTBA, B-DBA, and greedy, respectively. Combining the algorithms improves task assignment in MCS for both total task quality and sensing time. The results demonstrate that combining the two algorithms in LTBA is the best performance for total task quality and total sensing time, and the greedy algorithm follows it then B-DBA. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

The main focus of the CCN caching module is data dissemination within the network. Most of the existing strategies of in-network caching in CCN store the content at the maximum number of routers along the downloading path. Consequently, content redundancy in the network increases significantly, whereas the cache hit ratio and network performance decrease due to the unnecessary utilization of limited cache storage. Moreover, content redundancy adversely affects the cache resources, hit ratio, latency, bandwidth utilization, and server load. We proposed an in-network caching placement strategy named Coupling Parameters to Optimize Content Placement (COCP) to address the content redundancy and associated problems. The novelty of the technique lies in its capability to minimize content redundancy by creating a balanced cache space along the routing path by considering request rate, distance, and available cache space. The proposed approach minimizes the content redundancy and content dissemination within the network by using appropriate locations while increasing the cache hit ratio and network performance. The COCP is implemented in the simulator (Icarus) to evaluate its performance in terms of the cache hit ratio, path stretch, latency, and link load. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed COCP strategy. The proposed COCP technique has been compared with the existing state-of-the-art techniques, namely, Leave Copy Everywhere (LCE), Leave Copy Down (LCD), ProbCache, Cache Less for More (CL4M), and opt-Cache. The results obtained with different cache sizes and popularities show that our proposed caching strategy can achieve up to 91.46% more cache hits, 19.71% reduced latency, 35.43% improved path stretch and 38.14% decreased link load.

Smart dust is a technology that works with the combination of many tiny sensors which is highly useful for obtaining remote sensing information from rough terrains. The tiny sensors are sprinkled in large numbers on rough terrains using airborne distribution through drones or aircraft without manually setting their locations. Although it is clear that a number of remote sensing applications can benefit from this technology, but the small size of smart dust fundamentally restricts the integration of advanced hardware on tiny sensors. This raises many challenges including how to estimate the location of events sensed by the smart dusts. Existing solutions on estimating the location of events sensed by the smart dusts are not suitable for monitoring rough terrains as these solutions depend on relay sensors and laser patterns which have their own limitations in terms of power constraint and uneven surfaces. The study proposes a novel machine learning based localization algorithm for estimating the location of events. The approach utilizes timestamps (time of arrival) of sensed events received at base stations by assembling them into a multidimensional vector and input to a machine learning classifier for estimating the location. Due to the unavailability of real smart dusts, we built a simulator for analysing the accuracy of the proposed approach for monitoring forest fire.

However, to process such large volumes of data, the existing cloud computing platforms offer limited resources due to their distance from IoT devices. Consequently, cloud-computing systems produce intolerable latency problems for latency-sensitive real-time applications. Therefore, a new paradigm called fog computing makes use of computing nodes in the form of mobile devices, which utilize and process the real-time IoT devices data in orders of milliseconds.

In concept, blockchain has a linear structure that grows with the number of transactions entered. This growth in size is the main obstacle to the blockchain, which makes it unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT environments. Moreover, conventional consensus algorithms such as PoW, PoS are very computationally heavy. This paper solves these problems by introducing a new lightweight blockchain structure and lightweight consensus algorithm. The Multi-Zone Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) Blockchain (Multizone-DAG-Blockchain) framework is proposed for the fog-based IoT environment. In this context, fog computing technology is integrated with the IoT to offload IoT tasks to the fog nodes, thus preserving the energy consumption of the IoT devices. Both IoT and fog nodes are initially authenticated using a non-cloneable physical function- based validation mechanism (DPUF-VM) in which multiple authentication certificates are verified in the blockchain. Each transaction is stored in a hash function in the blockchain using the lightweight CubeHash algorithm and signed by the Four-Q- Curve algorithm. In the cloud, sensitive data is stored as ciphertext. Fog nodes provide data security to avoid the energy consumption and complexity of IoT nodes. The fog node first performs a redundancy analysis using the Jaccard Similarity (JS) measure and sensitivity analysis using the Neutrosophic Neural Intelligent Network (N2IN) algorithm. A lightweight proof-of-authentication (PoAh) algorithm is presented and executed by the optimal consensus node selected by the bi- objective spiral optimization (BoSo) algorithm for transaction validation.

In recent years, LoRa (Long Range) wireless powered by LoRaWAN (LoRa Wide Area Network) protocol has attracted the attention of researchers for numerous applications in the IoT domain. LoRa is a low power, unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band-equipped wireless technology that utilizes a wide area network protocol, i.e., LoRaWAN, to incorporate itself into the network infrastructure. In this paper, we have evaluated the LoRaWAN communication protocol for the implementation of the IoT (Internet of Things) nodes' communication in a forest scenario. The outdoor performance of LoRa wireless in LoRaWAN, i.e., the physical layer, has been evaluated in the forest area of Kashirampur Uttarakhand, India. Hence, the present paper aims towards analyzing the performance level of the LoRaWAN technology by observing the changes in Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), with respect to the distance between IoT nodes. The article focuses on estimating network lifetime for a specific set of LoRa configuration parameters, hardware selection and power constraints. From the experimental results, it has been observed that transmissions can propagate to a distance of 300 m in the forest environment, while consuming approx. 63% less energy for spreading factor 7 at 2 dBm, without incurring significant packet loss with PRR greater than 80%. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Those devices have different wireless interfaces that generate incompatible wireless signals. Each signal has its own physical characteristics with signal modulation and demodulation scheme. When there exist different wireless devices, they can suffer from severe Cross-Technology Interferences (CTI). To reduce the communication overhead due to the CTI in the real IoT environment, a central coordinator can be able to detect and identify wireless signals existing in the same communication areas. This paper investigates how to classify various radio signals using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and attention mechanism. CNN can reduce the amount of computation by reducing weights by using convolution, and LSTM belonging to RNN models can alleviate the long-term dependence problem. Furthermore, attention mechanism can reduce the short-term memory problem of RNNs by reexamining the data output from the decoder and the entire data entered into the encoder at every point in time. To accurately classify radio signals according to their weights, we design a model based on CNN, LSTM, and attention mechanism. As a result, we propose a model CLARINet that can classify original data by minimizing the loss and detects changes in sequences. In a case of the real IoT environment with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee devices, we can normally obtain wireless signals from 10 to 20 dB. The accuracy of CLARINet's radio signal classification with CNN-LSTM and attention mechanism can be seen that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exhibits high accuracy at 16 dB to about 92.03%. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

In this paper, all processes in the event of Man overboard (MOB)are initiated for smart transportation. In MOB the falling person is totally dependent on the person who first saw the falling person. The main objective of this paper is to develop a solution to this significant problem. If a staff member or a passenger does not see the fall into the sea, undesirable situations such as disappearance, injury and death can occur during the period until the absence of the fallen person is noticed. In this paper, a comprehensive and improved solution is provided in terms of personnel and passenger security especially in all the floating elements, in which human resources are intensively involved like passengers, freight, logistics, fishing, business, yacht, leisure and naval vessels. In this case, if the ship’s personnel or passengers fall into the sea in any way, it detected the fallen person into the sea by the sensors in the portable emergency device, which each person will carry. The warning system is activated via the in-ship automation system to which the information is transmitted by wireless communication. Thus, the case of MOB will be determined quickly. Internet of things (IoT) has a key role in identifying the location and information of the person falling into the sea through sensors, radio frequency, GPS and connected devices.

Cognitive Internet of things (CIoT) technologies including inherent characteristics of cognitive radio (CR) are potential candidates to develop a monitoring and early warning system (MEWS) that helps in efficiently utilizing the short response time to save lives during flash floods. However, most CIoT devices are battery-limited and thus, it reduces the lifetime of the MEWS. To tackle these problems, we propose a CIoT-based MEWS to slash the fatalities of flash floods. To extend the lifetime of the MEWS by conserving the limited battery energy of CIoT sensors, we formulate a resource assignment problem for maximizing energy efficiency. To solve the problem, at first, we devise a polynomial-time heuristic energy-efficient scheduler (EES-1). However, its performance can be unsatisfactory since it requires an exhaustive search to find local optimum values without consideration of the overall network energy efficiency. To enhance the energy efficiency of the proposed EES-1 scheme, we additionally formulate an optimization problem based on a maximum weight matching bipartite graph. Then, we additionally propose a Hungarian algorithm-based energy-efficient scheduler (EES-2), solvable in polynomial time. The simulation results show that the proposed EES-2 scheme achieves considerably high energy efficiency in the CIoT-based MEWS, leading to the extended lifetime of the MEWS without loss of throughput performance. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

However, due to the enormous amount of computations required by DNN. Therefore, performing DNN inference tasks locally is problematic for resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Existing cloud approaches are sensitive to problems like erratic communication delays and unreliable remote server performance. The utilization of IoT device collaboration to create distributed and scalable DNN task inference is a very promising strategy. The existing research, on the other hand, exclusively looks at the static split method in the scenario of homogeneous IoT devices. As a result, there is a pressing need to investigate how to divide DNN tasks adaptively among IoT devices with varying capabilities and resource constraints, and execute the task inference cooperatively. Two major obstacles confront the aforementioned research problems: 1) In a heterogeneous dynamic multi-device environment, it is difficult to estimate the multi-layer inference delay of DNN tasks; 2) It is difficult to intelligently adapt the collaborative inference approach in real time. As a result, a multi-layer delay prediction model with fine-grained interpretability is proposed initially. Furthermore, for DNN inference tasks, evolutionary reinforcement learning (ERL) is employed to adaptively discover the approximate best split strategy. Experiments show that, in a heterogeneous dynamic environment, the proposed framework can provide considerable DNN inference acceleration. When the number of devices is 2, 3, and 4, the delay acceleration of the proposed algorithm is 1.81 times, 1.98 times and 5.28 times that of the EE algorithm, respectively. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","Distributed computing; IoT; Neural networks; Reinforcement learning","Distributed computer systems; Internet of things; Reinforcement learning; Communication delays; Heterogeneous dynamics; Intelligent applications; Machine-learning; Multi-layers; Network inference; Neural-networks; Optimal frameworks; Task inference; Video recognition; Deep neural networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122729312

The analysis of investigated tags is performed in CST MWS in the frequency range of 1–12 GHz for the determination of the unique signature resonance characteristics of each tag in terms of its back-scattered horizontal and vertical mono-static radar cross section (RCS). The analysis reflects that each tag has its own unique electromagnetic signature (EMS) due to the changing current distribution of metallic resonator. This EMS of each tag could be used for the robust detection and recognition of all realized 28 Arabic alphabet tags. The study also discusses, for the first time, the effect of the change in font type and size of realized tags on their EMS.

The interconnection of devices means there is the possibility of challenges such as security, trustworthiness, reliability, confidentiality, and so on. To address these issues, we have proposed a novel group theory (GT)-based binary spring search (BSS) algorithm which consists of a hybrid deep neural network approach. The proposed approach effectively detects the intrusion within the IoT network. Initially, the privacy-preserving technology was implemented using a blockchain-based methodology. Security of patient health records (PHR) is the most critical aspect of cryptography over the Internet due to its value and importance, preferably in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Search keywords access mechanism is one of the typical approaches used to access PHR from a database, but it is susceptible to various security vulnerabilities. Although blockchain-enabled healthcare systems provide security, it may lead to some loopholes in the existing state of the art. In literature, blockchain-enabled frameworks have been presented to resolve those issues. However, these methods have primarily focused on data storage and blockchain is used as a database. In this paper, blockchain as a distributed database is proposed with a homomorphic encryption technique to ensure a secure search and keywords-based access to the database. Additionally, the proposed approach provides a secure key revocation mechanism and updates various policies accordingly. As a result, a secure patient healthcare data access scheme is devised, which integrates blockchain and trust chain to fulfill the efficiency and security issues in the current schemes for sharing both types of digital healthcare data. Hence, our proposed approach provides more security, efficiency, and transparency with cost-effectiveness. We performed our simulations based on the blockchain-based tool Hyperledger Fabric and OrigionLab for analysis and evaluation. We compared our proposed results with the benchmark models, respectively. Our comparative analysis justifies that our proposed framework provides better security and searchable mechanism for the healthcare system. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the IoT devices also hold sensitive data of the user which when sabotaged leads to a loss of the user's information, goodwill, or capital. When the data is shared via an unreliable connection it paves way for several cybersecurity attacks and in order to overcome this problem, an optimal homomorphic scheme designed using the hybrid Heat transfer search and Grey wolf optimization (HHTS-GWO) algorithm known as OHGHE is developed. The OHGHE algorithm is used for encoding sensitive information by selecting an optimal key with the maximum key breaking size and it also overcomes the vulnerabilities present in the state-of-art techniques. An Aquila algorithm optimized Adaptive convolutional kernel-based Artificial Neural Network (AOACK-ANN) is used to classify the sensitive and non-sensitive IoT data received from the devices and the sensitive data is secured using an OHGHE scheme. The AOACK-ANN classifier is also capable of identifying the nine different attacks present in the real-time IoT testbed dataset(TON IoT). The proposed AOACK-ANN security technique offers accuracy, precision, F1-Score, and testing time of 99.57%, 99.35%, 98.95%, and 8.36 seconds.

However, due to the resource-constrained nature, lack of physical protection and security requirements of the inherent protocol, LLNs are vulnerable to attacks that primarily alter the working of the RPL protocol and disrupt the ongoing communication. Therefore, it is a high profit and desperate target of many attackers. Our work offers a detailed overview of one such significant threat to RPL known as the rank attack. Considering the resource-constrained nature of the IoT devices, we propose and evaluate a lightweight and efficient method to mitigate and isolate the rank attack. Specifically, our approach uses a novel Echelon Metric Based Objective Function (EMBOF) over the default RPL to calculate and check the legitimacy of the advertised rank. The Echelon value is additively determined by the root node and the corresponding parent node(s) in the RPL network topology. Our approach not only detects the attacker node(s) but also isolates it immediately. We implement and evaluate our approach through extensive simulations in Cooja, a Contiki operating system (OS) based simulator.

Although many systems have been used to detect falls, they are limited by the computational complexity of the algorithm.

Emerging methods reduce the workload of servers by transferring certain computing tasks from cloud servers to edge computing platforms. To this end, this study developed a fall detection system based on neuromorphic computing hardware, which streamlines and transplants the neural network model of the back-end computer to the edge computing platform. Through the neural network model with integer 8 bit precision deployed on the edge computing platform, the object photos obtained by the camera are converted into human motion features, and a support vector machine is then used for classification.

IoT networks largely rely on distributed access of billions of devices, but are still lagging in terms of combined reliability and low latency. To mend that shortcoming, it is paramount to adapt existing random access methods for the IoT setting. In this article, we shed light on one of the modern candidates for random access protocols fitted for IoT: The 'Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA' (IRSA). As self-managing solutions are needed to overcome the challenges of IoT, we study the IRSA random access scheme in a distributed setting where groups of users, with fixed traffic loads, are competing for ALOHA-type channel access. To that aim, we adopt a distributed game-theoretic approach where two classes of IoT devices learn autonomously their optimal IRSA protocol parameters to optimize selfishly their own effective throughput. Through extensive simulations, we assess the notable efficiency of the game based distributed approach. We also show that our IRSA game attains the Nash equilibrium (NE) via the 'better reply' strategy, and we quantify the price of anarchy in comparison with a centralized approach. Our results imply that user competition does not fundamentally impact the performance of the IRSA protocol. © 2021 IEEE.","game theory; Internet of Things; IRSA; Random access","Computation theory; Internet of things; Iterative decoding; Silicon carbide; Game; Game-theoretic; Irregular repetition slotted ALOHA""; Iterative decodings; Nash equilibria; Random access; Receiver; Slotted Aloha; Slotted ALOHA protocol; Technological enhancement; Game theory",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122559332

However, these devices possess various security flaws resulting from the lack of defense mechanisms and hardware security support, therefore making them vulnerable to cyber attacks. In addition, IoT gateways provide very limited security features to detect such threats, especially the absence of intrusion detection methods powered by deep learning. Indeed, deep learning models require high computational power that exceeds the capacity of these gateways. In this paper, we introduce Realguard, an DNN-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) directly operated on local gateways to protect IoT devices within the network. The superiority of our proposal is that it can accurately detect multiple cyber attacks in real time with a small computational footprint. This is achieved by a lightweight feature extraction mechanism and an efficient attack detection model powered by deep neural networks. Our evaluations on practical datasets indicate that Realguard could detect ten types of attacks (e.g., port scan, Botnet, and FTP-Patator) in real time with an average accuracy of 99.57%, whereas the best of our competitors is 98.85%.

The first integrator of the ∆∑ ADC is based on a positive feedback DC-gain enhancement two-stage amplifier due to its high linearity and low-noise operations. To mitigate both the offset and 1/f noise, a suggested delay-time chopper negative-R stabilization technique is applied around the first integrator. A 65-nm CMOS process implements the CT ∆∑ ADC. The supply voltage of the CMOS circuit is 1.2-V while 0.96-mW is the power consumption and 0.1-mm2 is the silicon area. The M&amp;NEMS microphone and ∆∑ ADC complete circuit are fabricated and measured. Over a working frequency bandwidth of 20-kHz, the measurement results of the proposed IoT system reach a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 102.8-dB.

Over the last century, the Internet of Things (IoT) has expanded quickly, with more than 25 million linked gadgets anticipated by 2020. In the future, the amount of information generated from these gadgets will grow by a factor of ten. Out of this, IoT sensors generate a huge quantity of information in a variety of various formats with variable reliability characterized by its speed in terms of temporal and location dependence. For example, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms may play a key role in guaranteeing safety and permission based on biomedicine, as well as anomaly recognition to enhance the accessibility and security of Internet of Things systems. As an alternative, hackers use learning techniques to exploited weaknesses in intelligent IoT devices. As a result of this, we suggest in this article that the safety of IoT devices may be improved by identifying spam using ML techniques. Spam Identification in IoT utilizing ML Framework is suggested to accomplish this goal. A huge collection of input features sets is used to test five ML models. Each algorithm calculates a spam score based on the input characteristics that have been further improved. According to numerous criteria, this score represents the dependability of IoT devices.

The rapid development of local computing devices and container-based virtualization enabled the application of fog computing within the IoT environment. However, it is necessary to utilize algorithm-based service scheduling that considers the targeted QoS parameters to optimize the service performance and reach the potential of the fog computing concept. In this paper, we first describe our categorization of IoT services that affects the execution of our scheduling algorithm. Secondly, we propose our scheduling algorithm that considers the context of processing devices, user context, and service context to determine the optimal schedule for the execution of service components across the distributed fog-to-cloud environment. The conducted simulations confirmed the performance of the proposed algorithm and showcased its major contribution—dynamic scheduling, i.e., the responsiveness to the volatile QoS parameters due to changeable network conditions.

Nevertheless, the use of such apps may indirectly magnify the attack surface of the IoT device itself and expose the end-user to security and privacy breaches. Therefore, a key question arises: do these apps curtail their functionality to the minimum needed, and additionally, are they secure against known vulnerabilities and flaws? In seek of concrete answers to the aforesaid question, this work scrutinizes more than forty chart-topping Android official apps belonging to six diverse mainstream categories of IoT devices.

The results collected span several axes, namely sensitive permissions, misconfigurations, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and other issues, including trackers, manifest data, shared software, and more.

To reduce power consumption, the duty cycle protocol is divided into a listen section and a sleep section, and data can only be received when the receiving node is in the listen section. In this paper, high-priority transmission preempts lowpriority transmission by distinguishing between high-priority preamble and low-priority preamble. However, even when a high priority transmission preempts a low priority transmission such that the high priority transmission is received first, if the sleep period is very long, the delay may be large. To solve this problem, the high priority short preamble and high priority data reduce receiver sensitivity and increase coverage through repeated transmission. If there are several receiving nodes within a wide coverage, the receiving node that wakes up first can receive the transmission, thus reducing the delay. The delay can also be further reduced by alternately reducing the sleep cycle of one node among the receiving nodes that can receive it. This paper shows that emergent data can be transmitted effectively and reliably by reducing the delay of high-priority data to a minimum through the use of preemption, coverage extension, and an asymmetric sleep cycle. © 2021 by the authors.

In the proposed method, the source node makes multiple attempts to search for a route towards the destination by expanding disk-like patterns originating from the source node. The source node increases the search area in each attempt, accommodating more nodes in the search process. As a result, the probability of finding the destination increases, which reduces energy consumption and time delay of routing.

This model takes into account SLA requirements and it is characterised with linear time complexity, simplicity of computations and input metrics (e.g., combination of SLA for CPU and its workload), where all of the input data are aligned to the same range. Then, we evaluate time complexity and provide a measurement to demonstrate the reliability of the model application. The results show that the proposed model is efficient for large number of the IoT agents. It is approximately 98 times faster in computation with 1,000 systems when compared with [D. Ursino, et al., 2020] and 51 times faster in computations with 1,000 systems when compared with [J. Yao, et al., 2019]. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud-native IoT; IoT; mathematical model; multi-agent systems; real-time reliability evaluation; reliability model","Cloud computing; Complex networks; Interactive computer systems; Internet of things; Multi agent systems; Reliability; Cloud-computing; Cloud-native IoT; Computational modelling; Multi agent; Real - Time system; Real- time; Real-time reliability evaluations; Reliability modelling; Resource-efficient; Servicelevel agreement (SLA); Real time systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122323953

With the acceptance of IoT as a major part of the technology of Industry 4.0, the notion of leveraging the Internet in industries to enable automation and reconfigure existing industrial processes has greatly evolved. By introducing smart technology and intelligent processes, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is committed to bringing high operational efficiency, enhanced productivity, and effective management to industrial assets. Despite this, the reliance of IIoT on central architecture presents numerous challenges, including the security and maintenance of smart devices, privacy issues owing to third-party participation, and massive computations conducted by a central entity, all of which prevent its widespread adoption in businesses. Emerging blockchain technologies have the potential to transform IIoT platforms and applications. A distributed and decentralized approach followed by blockchain might offer interesting solutions to the challenges raised by IIoT. Furthermore, 5G networks are expected to deliver excellent solutions to meet the demands of decentralized systems, with a focus on application-specific vulnerabilities. Blockchain and IIoT, enabled by 5G, is a viable option to fully explore the potential of contemporary industry. In this context, this article analyzes and examines recent achievements to highlight the major obstacles in blockchain-IIoT convergence and presents a framework for potential solutions. A well-organized literature review by analyzing the existing work in three primary areas: blockchain consensus algorithms used in existing IoT and IIoT applications, blockchain for 5G-enabled IoT networks, and blockchain in industry have been performed, with major findings summarized in each area.

The opportunistic social network composed of these mobile smart devices is a manifestation of the current network technology being upgraded to a new level. How to better perceive the spatiotemporal movement stated information about opportunistic social network nodes and establishing a suitable information prediction model is the key for the current research of opportunistic social networks. In the social network environment where widely distributed terminal carriers are members of the society, the network has the characteristics of sparsely distributed nodes, fast movement, and highly dynamic typologies, etc. Data transmission of nodes will cause great energy and overhead during the transmission. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes an efficient path-sense message transmission strategy (EPST) based on Internet of Things systems in opportunistic social networks. It is a strategy proposed combining the social relationship and mobility characteristics of nodes. Furthermore, it proposes the problem of how to use the locally connected paths in opportunistic social networks.

Electrocardiography (ECG) is the standard for cardiac monitoring and arrhythmia identification, but it is inconvenient for long-time remote monitoring. Recently, Magnetocardiography (MCG) sensors that operate at room temperature became available based on spintronic sensors. However, MCG analysis is affected by the low-frequency noise present at the sensors. In this paper, we present an artificial intelligence (AI)-aided multi-model pipeline combining two AI architectures, defined as model-M1 and model-M2, targeted for ultra-edge Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to simulate arrhythmia detection. Model-M1 is a denoising preprocessor based on a sliding-window assisted deep-learning (DL) model. We investigate various methods to achieve high accuracy with lightweight computation. Model-M2 is a lightweight DL model that analyzes denoised ECG output from model-M1 to identify arrhythmia. We use multiple publicly available clinically annotated datasets to evaluate our proposal. We find that denoising by model-M1 retains the features, which assist the model-M2 in achieving high classification accuracy, compared to using a conventional moving average filter.

Due to the different coverage of the power Internet of Things, this paper proposes a node model based on the node network theory of blockchain technology. This model divides network nodes into data consumer nodes, data storage nodes, routing node, and coordination nodes according to business requirements. Through the cooperation of the four types of nodes, data sharing between multiple power Internet of Things can be realized efficiently. To solve the problem of low security in data sharing, this paper constructs a data transmission contribution analysis model of network nodes and a data access authorization model. The data transmission contribution degree model can fairly evaluate the behavior of network nodes based on the contribution degree, so as to quickly find malicious nodes. The data access authorization model calculates the entropy weight of each Internet of Things according to the trust level, thereby calculating the credibility of data sharing. To solve the problem of low transmission reliability of network nodes, a set of alternative links is constructed for data sharing routes. With load balancing as the goal, a relative cost value evaluation model is constructed for each route. The shortest route with the best relative cost value is regarded as the optimal data sharing route.

In the proposed scheme, a base station communicates with two destinations via a designated backscatter device. It is assumed that the relay node is fitted with two different interfaces and can simultaneously collect/decode and backscatter the received source signals. Such transmission mechanism benefits to design various applications in IoT as well as wireless systems with improved performance. To exhibit system performance metrics, the outage probability and the ergodic capacity of the recipient nodes are derived analytically. Furthermore, it is shown that employing AmBC NOMA together with CR for secondary communication can significantly improve overall network performance in terms of the achievable throughput in delay-limited and delay-tolerant modes and outage probability.

The authors have developed a system for remote monitoring of microclimate parameters of wild bee colonies based on the latest LoRaWAN technology. For studying the monitoring system based on the selected data transmission technology, data collection and transmission devices are implemented in two variants – based on ready-made monoblock devices (Variant 1) and composite devices (Variant 2) based on the Atmega328P microcontroller and photovoltaic power supply system with digital temperature and humidity sensors. Field tests of an experimental remote monitoring system were carried out in actual working conditions without power supply and communication systems. The tests involved 15 monoblock ready-made RAK7204 devices (Variant 1) and nine composite devices (Variant 2) based on the Atmega328P microcontroller. After the tests, Variant 1 was excluded from further use in research due to mass failure. Variant 2 passed the tests and participated in further research. The parameters of the power supply system of measuring devices and gateways are analyzed. The results of year-round monitoring of microclimate parameters of bee colonies were obtained. The study results prove the efficiency of the monitoring system based on LoRaWAN technology with the Atmega328P microcontroller devices and its operation comfort. During the study, it was recorded that the outer air temperature dropped to –36 °C. During the same period, the internal temperature significantly exceeded the air temperature.

However, excessively high transmission power can cause an energy outage of an IoT device and have a detrimental effect on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of neighbor IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a neighbor-aware NOMA scheme (NA-NOMA) where each IoT device determines whether to transmit data to the base station and the transmission power at each time epoch in a distributed manner with the consideration of its energy level and other devices’ transmission powers. To maximize the aggregated data rate of IoT devices while keeping an acceptable average energy outage probability, a constrained stochastic game model is formulated, and the solution of the model is obtained using a best response dynamics-based algorithm. Evaluation results show that NA-NOMA can increase the average data rate up to 22% compared with a probability-based scheme while providing a sufficiently low energy outage probability (e.g., 0.05). © 2022 by the authors.

Such monitoring performed by the physical models of the atmosphere is unstable and inaccurate. Machine Learning (ML) techniques on the other hand are more robust in capturing the dynamics in the environment. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to build a cost-effective standardized environment monitoring system (IoT-EMS) in volunteer computing environment. In volunteer computing, the volunteers (people) share their resources for distributed computing to perform a task (environment monitoring). The system is based on the Internet of Things and is controlled and accessed remotely through the Arduino platform (volunteer resource). In this system, the volunteers record the environment information from the surrounding through different sensors. Then the sensor readings are uploaded directly to a web server database, from where they can be viewed anytime and anywhere through a website. Analytics on the gathered time-series data is achieved through ML data modeling using R Language and RStudio IDE. Experimental results show that the system is able to accurately predict the trends in temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide level, and carbon dioxide.

The algorithm improved the traditional Ant Lion Optimizer by converting the smart IoT meter test suite reduction problem into a binary coverage problem and combining the Greedy Algorithm to obtain the optimal test case subset. The experimental results showed that the algorithm based on Ant Lion Optimizer performed better on the test suite reduction problems compared to similar algorithms. © 2022, Strojarski Facultet.

Such events often require restarting wastewater treatment plants, which cost up to a hundred thousand Euros. A system for localization and quantification of pollutants in utility networks could discourage such behavior and indicate a culprit if it happens. We propose an enhanced algorithm for multisensor data fusion for the detection, localization, and quantification of pollutants in wastewater networks. The algorithm processes data from multiple heterogeneous sensors in real-time, producing current estimates of network state and alarms if one or many sensors detect pollutants. Our algorithm models the network as a directed acyclic graph, uses adaptive peak detection, estimates the amount of specific compounds, and tracks the pollutant using a Kalman filter. We performed numerical experiments for several real and artificial sewage networks, and measured the quality of discharge event reconstruction. We report the correctness and performance of our system. We also propose a method to assess the importance of specific sensor locations. The experiments show that the algorithm’s success rate is equal to sensor coverage of the network. Moreover, the median distance between nodes pointed out by the fusion algorithm and nodes where the discharge was introduced equals zero when more than half of the network nodes contain sensors. The system can process around 5000 measurements per second, using 1 MiB of memory per 4600 measurements plus a constant of 97 MiB, and it can process 20 tracks per second, using 1.3 MiB of memory per 100 tracks. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the current SCM systems are insufficient to provide product legitimacy, transaction privacy, and security. Therefore, this research proposes a secure SCM system for the authenticity of the products based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology. The IoT-enabled Quick Response (QR) scanner and the blockchain-integrated distributed system will allow all the SCM stakeholders to begin secure and private transactions for their products or services. Resulting, the consumer will receive an authentic and genuine product from the original producer. A lightweight asymmetric key encryption technique, i.e., elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain technology with on-chain smart contracts are applied for distributed IoT devices to make the authentication process faster and lighter. Each SCM stakeholder is registered by the service provider and receives corresponding public and private keys, which will be used for the authentication process of the participants and IoT devices. The authenticated QR scanner records all transactions on the blockchain. Consequently, there will be no human intervention for the SCM transactions.

Wireless Sensor Networks assisted IoT applications have suffered from challenges like security, privacy preservation, QoS, and network lifetime. Addressing these challenges has essential for IoT-enabled healthcare systems to protect the patient’s sensitive data from the different threats. We propose a novel methodology called Cross-Layer and Cryptography-based Secure Routing (CLCSR) protocol to perform attack detection, privacy preservations, and secure data transmission. The proposed CLCSR protocol consists of two phases: (1) the cross-layer mechanism of secure clustering and (2) lightweight cryptography for privacy preservation of users and data. After network deployment, we have designed secure and optimal CH selection by computing the cross-layer parameters. In the first phase, we propose a cross-layer probability model to correctly identify multi-layer security threats. This integrated process of attack detection and CH-selection improves the network performance. In the second phase, we focus on privacy preservation medical information and users in the network. To protect sensitive medical information and user identity, lightweight Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based authentication and authorization algorithms for privacy preservation. The hybrid encryption algorithm using 256 bit ECC public key proposed in CLCSR protocol followed by the signature verification. The data transmission phase uses the periodically computed cross-layer probability to select the relay node to reduce the data loss. We use Network Simulator (NS2) to implement and evaluate the CLCSR protocol along with state-of-art protocols.

This paper introduces a novel non-cryptographic approach to preserve electrocardiograph (ECG) data confidentiality and integrity in the EHR environment. The main objective of the proposed anonymization algorithm is to obscure the patient's cardiac information during transmission and to protect information stored in the cloud database. Although we focus on ECG data, generalization to other types of clinical data can be derived using the proposed method. Performance evaluation of the proposed scheme showed that the algorithm conceals both fiducial and non-fiducial features of the data. Therefore, confidentiality feature is preserved. This paper examined confidentiality of the anonymized data using the Percentage Residual Difference (PRD) and investigated the integrity of the reconstructed data in terms of cross-correlation. Security analysis carried out using the PRD, brute force attack, and performance comparison between the proposed algorithm and existing methods. Evaluation showed that the proposed scheme offers a secure non-cryptographic model for transmission and storing clinical data in the cloud.

In our access edge concept, in which motion control is performed from a central office, the delay becomes large due to Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) when the Passive Optical Network (PON) is adopted as the access system. No existing motion control method considers the delay changes of the DBA algorithm. We rectify this omission by proposing a novel real-time and high-precision motion control method that links the PON device and the controller. The proposed method can improve the control performance while maintaining the bandwidth utilization efficiency without changing the DBA delay specified to meet the requirements. In the proposed method, the delay in the PON system is calculated by using a delay model based on the setting parameter received from the communication device, and is used for delay compensation control. An experiment shows that, unlike the conventional method which becomes unstable and fails to realize control, the proposed method achieves high resolution control within 4 s, which demonstrates the feasibility of motion control for factory automation using edge computing in PON systems. © 2013 IEEE.","access network; delays; dynamic bandwidth allocation; edge computing; Internet of Things; motion control; networked control systems; passive optical network","Bandwidth; Edge computing; Ethernet; Factory automation; Frequency allocation; Interactive computer systems; Internet of things; Motion control; Networked control systems; Passive optical networks; Access network; Control methods; Control performance; Delay; Dynamic bandwidth allocation; Edge computing; Optical network units; Production facility; Real - Time system; Real time systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122093831

In software development, agile methods are increasingly adopted in critical software projects where security risks are prominent challenges. This adoption stems from the fact that agile methods are highly iterative and support delivering services and products in smaller batches which allows security professionals to seamlessly integrate software development security activities with agile methodologies. In addition, the iterative nature of agile software development encourages frequent inspections, tests, and patching of software systems to mitigate cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. Considering the massive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) products, the challenge of software development while addressing the security and safety concerns of these devices will continue to increase. This paper presents a comprehensive and detailed review of agile software development in the context of IoT, ITS, and their cybersecurity and risk challenges. Furthermore, we provide a systematic comparison of the reviewed literature based on a set of defined criteria.

These services are realized through control and monitoring applications that are typically developed using artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) based algorithms, that play a significant role to highlight the efficiency of traditional healthcare systems. Current personalized healthcare services are dedicated in a specific environment to support technological personalization (e.g., personalized gadgets/devices). However, they are unable to consider different inter-related health conditions, leading to inappropriate diagnosis and affect sustainability and the long-term health/life of patients. Towards this problem, the state-of-the-art Healthcare 5.0 technology has evolved that supersede previous healthcare technologies. The goal of healthcare 5.0 is to achieve a fully autonomous healthcare service, that takes into account the interdependent effect of different health conditions of a patient. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on personalized healthcare services. In particular, we first present an overview of key requirements of comprehensive personalized healthcare services (CPHS) in modern healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT), including the definition of personalization and an example use case scenario as a representative for modern HIoT. Second, we explored a fundamental three-layer architecture for IoT-based healthcare systems using both AI and non-AI-based approaches, considering key requirements for CPHS followed by their strengths and weaknesses in the frame of personalized healthcare services. Third, we highlighted different security threats against each layer of IoT architecture along with the possible AI and non-AI-based solutions.

As this technology advances further, the need to exploit detection and weakness awareness increases to prevent unauthorized access to critical resources and business functions, thereby rendering the system unavailable.

The unmonitored control and the extensive use of fossil fuel in water-table pumping for irrigation exacerbate global warming and harm the environment. Along with the rapid population growth and the concomitant increase in the demand for food, optimal usage of water-table and energy is becoming a must and indispensable for sustainable agriculture. In this context, Smart Agriculture (SA) is emerging as a promising field that leverages ICT (Information and Communication Technology) to optimize resources' usage while enhancing crops' yields. In this paper, we present an integral SA solution that leverages cost-effectiveness. Commercial solutions are costly and thus become impossible to adopt by small and medium farmers. Our solution revolves around three main axes: 1. Smart Water Metering promotes optimal usage and conservation of water-table (a.k.a., groundwater) via real-time data collection and monitoring using a Cloud-based IoT (Internet of Things) system; 2. Renewable-Energy integration promotes energy-efficient agriculture by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in water-table pumping, and 3. Smart Irrigation to promote good crops quality and quantity without harming the soil and the water-table ecosystems. Our solution has been deployed and tested in a real-world Smart Farm testbed. The results have shown that the adoption of our SA system reduces the amount of water consumption (with a traditional irrigation system) up to 71.8%. Finally, our solution is open-source and can be easily adopted and adapted by other researchers to promote the setting of a dedicated Cloud-based platform for water-table usage, especially in arid and sub-Saharan countries. © 2013 IEEE.","fuzzy logic control; information communication technology (ICT); Internet of Things (IoT); Smart agriculture (SA); wireless sensors networks (WSN)","Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Fuzzy logic; Global warming; Groundwater; Interactive computer systems; Internet of things; Irrigation; Population statistics; Real time systems; Water management; Fuzzy logic control; Information communication technology; Internet of thing; Real - Time system; Renewable energy source; Smart agriculture; Smart agricultures; Wireless communications; Wireless sensor network; Wireless sensor networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122063171

Cardiovascular diseases monitoring, usually involving electrocardiogram (ECG) traces analysis, is one of the most promising and high-impact applications. Nevertheless, to fully exploit the potential of IoMT in this domain, some steps forward are needed. First, the edge-computing paradigm must be added to the picture. A certain level of near-sensor processing has to be enabled, to improve the scalability, portability, reliability and responsiveness of the IoMT nodes. Second, novel, increasingly accurate data analysis algorithms, such as those based on artificial intelligence and Deep Learning, must be exploited. To reach these objectives, designers, and programmers of IoMT nodes, have to face challenging optimization tasks, in order to execute fairly complex computing tasks on low-power wearable and portable processing systems, with tight power and battery lifetime budgets. In this work, we explore the implementation of a cognitive data analysis algorithm, based on a convolutional neural network trained to classify ECG waveforms, on a resource-constrained microcontroller-based computing platform. To minimize power consumption, we add an adaptivity layer that dynamically manages the hardware and software configuration of the device to adapt it at runtime to the required operating mode. Our experimental results show that adapting the node setup to the workload at runtime can save up to 50power consumption.

The Ubiquitous use of tiny devices and embedded sensor frameworks has pushed IoT to the forefront of emerging technologies used in many applications like peer-to-peer networks, smart energy grids, home and building automation, vehicle to vehicle communication, and wearable computing devices. This massive growth and extensive use brought forth security risks that could hinder its commencement in many novel applications. The number of interconnected devices leads the way to several entry points for intruders and, along with it, security risks. The sensitive nature of the IoT applications such as health, automation, and energy grids cannot afford security risks. Traditional security mechanisms will not design or develop to secure such an emerging technology as IoT. Existing technologies have to be relied on with the non-existence of security mechanisms for this purpose. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is one such technology that can reduce the security risks in IoT. The central node vulnerability that can compromise the whole system can be mitigated by eliminating the need for a central node by using the distributed ledger. Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, has attracted tremendous attention and harnessed in itself a real-world value. However, computationally costly with limited scalability is not entirely suited for the IoT environment. IoT Application (IOTA) technology is the distributed ledger technology that can provide unlimited scalability specifically suitable for the IoT industry.

Conventional metal oxide-based semiconducting gas sensors have been considered as suitable candidates given their low-cost, high sensitivity, and long stability. However, the dominant sensing mechanism is based on the chemisorption of gas molecules which requires elevated temperatures to activate the catalytic reaction of target gas molecules with chemisorbed O, leaving the drawbacks of high-power consumption and poor selectivity. In this work, we introduce an alternative candidate of cobalt oxysulfide derived from the calcination of self-assembled cobalt sulfide micro-cages. It is found that the majority of S atoms are replaced by O in cobalt oxysulfide, transforming the crystal structure to tetragonal coordination and slightly expanding the optical bandgap energy. The H2 gas sensing performances of cobalt oxysulfide are fully reversible at room temperature, demonstrating peculiar p-type gas responses with a magnitude of 15% for 1% H2 and a high degree of selectivity over CH4, NO2, and CO2 . Such excellent performances are possibly ascribed to the physisorption dominating the gas–matter interaction.

With task scheduling and resource allocation considered with salient characteristics of cloud computing (CC) environment, this paper proposes a method called two-factor task scheduler and deep resource allocator (TFTS-DRA) based on IoT. In this method, each task is processed before its actual allocation to the cloud resources by cost and time-based divide and conquer task scheduling model. The resources are allocated using deep resource allocation model, which considers the auto encoder (AE) and fully connected neural network (FCNN) with energy consumption and transmission delay of cloud resources as constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed TFTS-DRA method performs in an extensive manner with higher throughput rate.

An effective data representation manner, which can fuse such complex information and enable cognitive manufacturing decision-making from a global perspective, is necessary and challenging. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a knowledge graph-based data representation approach for IIoT-enabled cognitive manufacturing and applies it in a Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) scenario. Based on the digital thread of manufacturing process data, a multi-layer manufacturing knowledge graph is established, including device sensing data, production processing data, and business processing data. With the established knowledge graph, a cognition-driven approach is proposed with a perception-cognition dual system, which achieves perception analysis and cognition decision-making in the resource allocation of the manufacturing process. Finally, responding to the orders of personalized products in a workshop is taken as an illustrative example. The performance of allocating resources of workshop devices under dynamic demand changes shows the advantages of the proposed approach. The proposed manner will lay the foundation for a human-like cognition for processing massive real-time industrial information in CPPS, thus paving a pathway towards the era of cognitive manufacturing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive manufacturing; Cyber-Physical Production System; Data fusion; Industrial Internet of Things; Knowledge graph","Data fusion; Data handling; Decision making; Graphic methods; Internet of things; Knowledge graph; Manufacture; Cognitive manufacturing; Cybe-physical production system; Cyber physicals; Data representations; Decisions makings; Graph-based; Knowledge graphs; Manufacturing process; Production system; Sensor/actuator; Cyber Physical System",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122026091

To better maintain and minimise these threats, using blockchain can play a significant role by auditing and recording all actions that occur while collecting the data and storing the same in the cloud. Due to the nature of consensus methods in a blockchain system, we introduced the uses of the interplanetary file system wherein the data collected will be stored in them and a hash value will be retrieved which will be sent to the blockchain and recorded.

The core concept of smart society emphasizes utilizing information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure to improve every aspect of life. Among the variety of smart services, eHealth is at the forefront of these promises. eHealth is rapidly gaining popularity to overcome the insufficient healthcare services and provide patient-centric treatment for the rising aging population with chronic diseases. Keeping in view the sensitivity of medical data, this interfacing between healthcare and technology has raised many security concerns. Among the many contemporary solutions, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is the dominant technology because of its inherent support for one-to-many transfer and fine-grained access control mechanisms to confidential medical data. ABE uses costly bilinear pairing operations, which are too heavy for eHealth’s tiny wireless body area network (WBAN) devices despite its proper functionality. We present an efficient and secure ABE architecture with outsourcing intense encryption and decryption operations in this work. For practical realization, our scheme uses elliptic curve scalar point multiplication as the underlying technology of ABE instead of costly pairing operations. In addition, it provides support for attribute/users revocation and verifiability of outsourced medical data. Using the selective-set security model, the proposed scheme is secure under the elliptic curve decisional Diffie–Hellman (ECDDH) assumption. The performance assessment and top-ranked value via the help of fuzzy logic’s evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method show that the proposed scheme is efficient and suitable for access control in eHealth smart societies. © 2022 by the authors.

Seaports are located at the focal point of institutional, industrial, and control activities in a jungle of interconnected information systems. System integration is setting considerable challenges when a group of independent providers are asked to implement complementary software functionalities. For this reason, seaports are the ideal playground where software is highly composite and tailored to a large variety of final users (from the so-called port communities). Although the target would be that of shaping the Port Authorities to be providers of (digital) innovation services, the state-of-the-art is still that of considering them as final users, or proxies of them. For this reason, we show how a canonical cloud, virtualizing a distributed architecture, can be structured to host different, possibly overlapped, tenants, slicing the information system at the infrastructure, platform, and software layers. Resources at the infrastructure and platform layers are shared so that a variety of independent applications can make use of the local calculus and access the data stored in a Data Lake. Such a cloud is adopted by the Port of Livorno as a rapid prototyping framework for the development and deployment of ICT innovation services.

Nevertheless, the unreliability of THz transmissions and the extreme heterogeneity of device requirements pose critical challenges for practical applications.

Bluetooth Mesh is an emerging networking technology, which can be used to organize a massive network with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. Managed-flooding protocol is used in Bluetooth Mesh to route the data packets. Although it is a highly desirable option when data transmission is urgent, it is inefficient in a larger and denser mesh network due to the collisions of broadcast data packets. In this paper, we introduce ACE: a Routing Algorithm based on Autonomous Channel Scheduling for Bluetooth Mesh Network. ACE relies on the existing Bluetooth Mesh messages to distribute routes without additional traffic overhead and conducts a beacon-aware routing update adaptively as the topology evolves. In ACE, BLE channel resources can be efficiently utilized by a channel scheduling scheme for each node locally and autonomously without any neighborly negotiation. We implement ACE on the nRF52840 from Nordic Semiconductor and evaluate its effectiveness on our testbed. Compared to the Bluetooth Mesh, our experiments proved that ACE could reduce the end-to-end latency by 16%, alleviate packets collisions issues, and increase the packet delivery ratio (PDR) by 30% under heavy traffic. Moreover, simulation results verified that ACE has better scalability when the size and density of networks become larger and denser. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition, the geographical areas involved in livestock grazing usually have difficult access with harsh orography and lack of communications infrastructure, thus the need to provide a low-power livestock localization and monitoring system is of paramount importance, which is crucial not for a sustainable agriculture, but also for the protection of native breeds and meats thanks to their controlled supervision. In this context, this work presents an Internet of things (IoT)-based system integrating low-power wide area (LPWA) technology, cloud, and virtualization services to provide real-time livestock location monitoring.

The Black Hole Attack (BHA) is considered one of the most affecting threats in the MANET in which the attacker node drops the entire data traffic and hence degrades the network performance. Therefore, it necessitates the designing of an algorithm that can protect the network from the BHA node. This article introduces Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV), a new updated routing protocol that combines the advantages of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. The combination of the SVM with ANN is the novelty of the proposed model that helps to identify the attackers within the discovered route using the AODV routing mechanism. Here, the model is trained using ANN but the selection of training data is performed using the ABC fitness function followed by SVM. The role of ABC is to provide a better route for data transmission between the source and the destination node. The optimized route, suggested by ABC, is then passed to the SVM model along with the node’s properties. Based on those properties ANN decides whether the node is a normal or an attacker node. The simulation analysis performed in MATLAB shows that the proposed work exhibits an improvement in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), throughput, and delay. To validate the system efficiency, a comparative analysis is performed against the existing approaches such as Decision Tree and Random Forest that indicate that the utilization of the SVM with ANN is a beneficial step regarding the detection of BHA attackers in the MANET-based IoT networks. © 2021 by the authors.

User needs using the theory of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) are investigated and researched, and smart air conditioners are researched and practiced on human interaction design. Firstly, in order to establish a user model, the questions and needs of the target users are explored through the questionnaire survey method. Secondly, from the perspective of ergonomics, the hardware and software interaction interface of the smart air conditioner is analyzed. Finally, the intelligent air conditioner is designed for HCI according to user needs, and the unsupervised feature value extraction of the vibration measurement signal of the outdoor unit of the household air conditioner is carried out by using the stacked autoencoder neural network. Three preliminary options for the design of remote controllers for air conditioners are proposed, and the fuzzy evaluation method is utilized to analyze and evaluate the three options. The research results show that the comprehensive evaluation results of the three preliminary options of the remote-control design are 0.78, 0.77, and 0.8 respectively. Compared with Option 1 and Option 2, Option 3 has obvious advantages. The design of Option 3 is more prominent in terms of comfort, aesthetics, and rationality. Therefore, Option 3 is selected as the final design solution. Under different hidden layer numbers and node numbers, the classification accuracy rate changes in a convex function. When the number of layers is 3 and the number of nodes is 100, the classification accuracy rate is the highest.

Therefore, the quality of food and food products concerns not only all the end consumers but also millions of employees and entrepreneurs within the global food industry. Achieving the best possible quality of food throughout all the engaged processes requires constantly tracing and monitoring several crucial environmental conditions that may have a significant impact on the products' quality. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a system of dedicated sensors paired with the Internet that can overcome and prevent issues within the food industry. The interconnected elements bear the responsibility for monitoring, evaluating, and tracking the conditions where the food products undergo processing, and it checks the products' quality throughout their life cycle. Nevertheless, even IIoT has its challenges. The first such challenge relates to the storage and accessibility of the obtained data. What can make the data readily available to all individuals and entities involved in the industry? The second significant challenge relates to tracing items that pass through numerous processes involving different parties. This work proposed ProChain, a Provenance-aware Traceability Framework for IoT-based Supply Chain Systems. A proposed comprehensive framework of all the information acquired by the sensors and the complete set of provenance data addressed these challenges. Additionally, a thorough simulation of the proposed framework on the Raspberry PI 3B IoT device reviewed the ProChain efficiency in the cloud and local simulation environments. ProChain demonstrated tractability, transparency, and complex security as examples of the principal attributes of the IOTA 2.0 protocol in the food industry. © 2013 IEEE.","Internet of Things; IoT; Provenance; Supply chain management; Traceability","Blockchain; Digital storage; Food products; Internet of things; Life cycle; Block-chain; Current values; End consumers; Environmental conditions; Food industries; Food system; Global economies; Provenance; Supply chain systems; Traceability; Supply chain management",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121804276

Specifically, we study six supervised learning methods that belong to three different classes: (1) ensemble meth-ods, (2) neural network methods, and (3) kernel methods. To evaluate the developed NIDSs, we use the distilled‐Kitsune‐2018 and NSL‐KDD datasets, both consisting of a contemporary real‐world IoT network traffic subjected to different network attacks. Standard performance evaluation metrics from the machine‐learning literature are used to evaluate the identification accuracy, error rates, and inference speed. Our empirical analysis indicates that ensemble methods provide better accuracy and lower error rates compared with neural network and kernel methods.

The data of target regions are collected by widely distributed sensing devices and transmitted to the processing center for aggregation and analysis as the basis of IoT. The quality of IoT services usually depends on the accuracy and integrity of data. However, due to the adverse environment or device defects, the collected data will be anomalous. Therefore, the effective method of anomaly detection is the crucial issue for guaranteeing service quality. Deep learning is one of the most concerned technology in recent years which realizes automatic feature extraction from raw data. In this article, the integrated model of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent autoencoder is proposed for anomaly detection. Simple combination of CNN and autoencoder cannot improve classification performance, especially, for time series. Therefore, we utilize the two-stage sliding window in data preprocessing to learn better representations. Based on the characteristics of the Yahoo Webscope S5 dataset, raw time series with anomalous points are extended to fixed-length sequences with normal or anomaly label via the first-stage sliding window. Then, each sequence is transformed into continuous time-dependent subsequences by another smaller sliding window. The preprocessing of the two-stage sliding window can be considered as low-level temporal feature extraction, and we empirically prove that the preprocessing of the two-stage sliding window will be useful for high-level feature extraction in the integrated model. After data preprocessing, spatial and temporal features are extracted in CNN and recurrent autoencoder for the classification in fully connected networks. Empiric results show that the proposed model has better performances on multiple classification metrics and achieves preferable effect on anomaly detection. © 2013 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; deep learning; Internet of Things (IoT); time series","Anomaly detection; Continuous time systems; Convolution; Extraction; Feature extraction; Internet of things; Recurrent neural networks; Anomaly detection; Auto encoders; Convolutional neural network; Data preprocessing; Deep learning; Integrated modeling; Internet of thing; Sliding Window; Temporal features; Times series; Time series",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121787301

The article presents the results of simulation tests and experimental laboratory tests of an electricity management system in order to reduce excessively high grid load or reduce excessively high grid voltage values resulting from increased production of prosumer RES. The research is based on the Elastic Energy Management (EEM) algorithm for smart appliances (SA) using IoT (Internet of Things) technology. The data for the algorithm was obtained from a message broker that implements the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. The complexity of selecting power settings for SA in the EEM algorithm required the use of a solution that is applied to the NP difficult problem class.

Then the steering angle value is passed to the raspberry pi that directs the L298 motor driver which direction the wheel should follow. Based upon this direction, L298 decides either forward or left or right or backwards movement. The 3-cell 12V LiPo battery handles the power supply to the raspberry pi and L298 motor driver. A buck converter regulates a 5V 3A power supply to the raspberry pi to be working.

To detect this type of attack, several Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been proposed for IoT networks based on machine learning and deep learning methods.

This paper proposes an aggregated mutual information-based feature selection approach with machine learning methods to enhance detection of IoT botnet attacks. In this study, the N-BaIoT benchmark dataset was used to detect botnet attack types using real traffic data gathered from nine commercial IoT devices. The dataset includes binary and multi-class classifications. The feature selection method incorporates Mutual Information (MI) technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and ANOVA f-test at finely-granulated detection level to select the relevant features for improving the performance of IoT Botnet classifiers. In the classification step, several ensemble and individual classifiers were used, including Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Task scheduling is one of the most demanding scopes after the trust computation inside the trustable nodes. The mobile devices and IoT devices transfer the resource‐intensive tasks towards mobile cloud computing. Some tasks are resource‐intensive and not trustable to allocate to the mobile cloud computing resources. This consequently gives rise to trust evaluation and data sync‐up of devices joining and leaving the network. The resources are more intensive for cloud computing and mobile cloud computing. Time, energy, and resources are wasted due to the nontrustable nodes. This research article proposes a multilevel trust enhancement approach for efficient task scheduling in mobile cloud environments. We first calculate the trustable tasks needed to offload towards the mobile cloud computing. Then, an efficient and dynamic scheduler is added to enhance the task scheduling after trust computation using social and environmental trust computation techniques. To improve the time and energy efficiency of IoT and mobile devices using the proposed technique, the energy computation and time request computation are compared with the existing methods from literature, which identified improvements in the results. Our proposed approach is centralized to tackle constant SyncUPs of incoming devices’ trust values with mobile cloud computing.

To cope with those challenges, digital twins that create a digital representation of physical entities by integrating real-time and real-world data seem to be a promising approach. This paper aims to provide an overview of digital twin applications in the food industry and analyze their challenges and potentials. Therefore, a literature review is executed to examine digital twin applications in the food supply chain. The applications found are classified according to a taxonomy and key elements to implement digital twins are identified. Further, the challenges and potentials of digital twin applications in the food industry are discussed. The survey revealed that the application of digital twins mainly targets the production (agriculture) or the food processing stage. Nearly all applications are used for monitoring and many for prediction. However, only a small amount focuses on the integration in systems for autonomous control or providing recommendations to humans. The main challenges of implementing digital twins are combining multidisciplinary knowledge and providing enough data.

In this proposed model, we perform data offloading at 5G using the fuzzification concept. Mobile IoT devices create tasks in the network and are offloaded in the cloud or mobile edge nodes based on energy consumption. Two base stations, small (SB) and macro (MB) stations, are initialized and the first tasks randomly computed.

Advances in electronics, computation and the internet of things are integrated for improving field inputs management. The aim of this paper is to present the design and implementation of an intelligent IoT-multiagent precision irrigation approach for improving water use efficiency in irrigation systems. The study site was the large-scale irrigation and drainage district of Chicamocha and Firavitoba (Usochicamocha) located in Boyacá - Colombia, where water is distributed from the Chicamocha riverbed. In the proposed system, irrigation is supervised and controlled in each field by an intelligent irrigation agent that autonomously prescribes and applies water amounts with agronomical criteria. The methodology was applied with real (cyber-physical) and virtual (simulated) intelligent agents and was extended to eleven pump stations that supply water to 5911 fields. Using a MQTT protocol, hundreds of irrigation intelligent agents report water prescriptions and crop characteristics to a master agent in each pump station, who creates a regional irrigation map to manage georeferenced field information and performs negotiation of water resources between agents according to supply availability. Field maps and intelligent irrigation agents can be visualized using devices with internet access. Results demonstrated that irrigation amounts were correctly applied on the fields, thus improving the water use efficiency.

The primary objective of IoUT is to develop a worldwide network of smart underwater-interconnected objects. It has wide-ranging aquatic applications, including surveillance, pollution reduction, monitoring offshore oil and gas pipelines, disaster prevention, and navigation assistance, making it as important as a terrestrial communication system. The underwater communication channel poses unique acoustic communication challenges that suffer from long propagation delay, low bandwidth, multipath, and fading. IoUT significantly differs from the conventional Internet of Things (IoT) due to disparate environmental conditions under the ocean that require re-designing the underwater communication channel model. In addition to the challenges mentioned above, end-to-end delay and efficient energy utilization are also of great concern. Therefore, in this research paper, diverse attributes of underwater acoustic communication, including the speed of sound, transmission loss, absorption, and ambient noise, are analyzed to design a channel model for underwater communication. These environmental conditions also make underwater acoustic channels highly variable, so efficient resources, including bandwidth and power, are required. Adaptive modulation is proposed to make the communications system efficient by considering the distance between nodes and the signal-to-noise ratio as channel state information. The proposed channel model critically analyzed the CSI factors, results show efficient bandwidth utilization and appropriate power consumption for the well-suited route. The proposed research also aims to reduce end-to-end propagation delay by considering vertical angle-based shortest path (efficient route) in the Multilevel rotating priority MRP-routing algorithm.

To countermeasure the aforementioned challenges, ultra-dense networking has been widely identified as a possible solution. However, the dense deployment of base stations (BSs) is not always possible or cost-efficient. Drone-base-stations (DBSs) can facilitate network expansion and efficiently address the requirements of NG-IoT. In addition, due to their flexibility, they can provide on-demand connectivity in emergency scenarios or address temporary increases in network traffic. Nevertheless, the optimal placement of a DBS is not a straightforward task due to the limited energy reserves and the increased signal quality degradation in air-to-ground links. To this end, swarm intelligence approaches can be attractive solutions for determining the optimal position of the DBS in the three-dimensional (3D) space.

Efficient QoS-aware service composition has been a challenging task in cloud computing. This challenge becomes more formidable in emerging resource-constrained computing paradigms, such as the Internet of Things and Fog. Service composition has regarded as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem that falls in the category of NP-hard. Historically, the proliferation of services added to problem complexity and navigated solutions from exact (none-heuristics) approaches to near-optimal heuristics and metaheuristics. Although metaheuristics have fulfilled some expectations, the quest for finding a high-quality, near-optimal solution has led researchers to devise hybrid methods. As a result, research on service composition shifts towards the hybridization of metaheuristics. Hybrid metaheuristics have been promising efforts to transcend the boundaries of metaheuristics by leveraging the strength of complementary methods to overcome base algorithm shortcomings. Despite the significance and frontier position of hybrid metaheuristics, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic research and survey in this field with a particular focus on strategies to hybridize traditional metaheuristics. This study's core contribution is to infer a framework for hybridization strategies by conducting a mapping study that analyses 71 papers between 2008 and 2020.

The intelligent manufacturing service mode, based on the concept of the product life cycle, completes the multi-source data production process analysis and the optimization of manufacturing, operation, and maintenance through intelligent industrial Internet of things and other means and improves the product life cycle management and operation mechanism. The smart product-service system (PSS) realizes the value-added of products by providing users with personalized products and value-added services, service efficiency, and sustainable development and gradually forms an Internet-product-service ecosystem. However, research on the PSS of RADs for special populations is relatively limited. Thus, this paper provides an overview of an IoT-based production model for RADs and a smart PSS-based development method of multimodal healthcare value-added services for special people. Taking the hand rehabilitation training devices for autistic children as a case, this paper verifies the effectiveness and availability of the proposed method. Compared with the traditional framework, the method used in this paper primarily helps evaluate rehabilitation efficacy, personalizes schemes for patients, provides auxiliary intelligent manufacturing service data and digital rehabilitation data for RAD manufacturers, and optimizes the product iteration development procedures by combining user-centered product interaction, multimodal evaluation, and value-added design.

Such technologies, which include in-Cloud data storage, large scale computation, advanced control, enterprise-wide-optimization, and machine-learning, offer opportunities for improved production management, rapid proto-typing, and lower cost. This paper describes the application and proof of concept (POC) of the Vitro base-architecture for Smart Manufacture. Benchmarking against current technology showed that the engineering time required for data reconciliation, rectification, and standardization is significantly reduced. Instead of spending 80% of their efforts on such activities, process engineers and data scientists started to spend most of their time on real-time process analysis and decision making. The cloud-based architecture used to support the development was developed under a cooperative project between Vitro and Microsoft. The architecture can be applied to other industry sectors, such as the chemicals, petro-chemicals, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and metallurgical industries. The current paper describes the data management component of the project. It describes the standardized storage formats used for uniform display of rectified process data in engineering units. We found that the MS Azure based system provides operators, process engineers, and managers alike, the data needed to run the process at or close to optimal conditions minute by minute, day by day, and week by week as product portfolios and markets change.

In this research, we have reported the development and deployment of ""MOOnitor"", a neck-mounted intelligent IoT device for cattle monitoring. The device facilitates classification of salient activities of cattle through appropriately positioned sensors. MOOnitor is an integration of a temperature sensor, a global positioning system (GPS) module, and a 3-axis accelerometer in a lightweight enclosure, which is attached to a halter that allows transmission of data to an IoT server using a microcontroller and a cellular GSM module. After acquiring the necessary sensory information, the most significant features were strategically extracted for enhanced data interpretation. Thereafter, optimally tuned eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forests classifiers were implemented to classify activities like ‘standing’, ‘lying’, ‘standing and ruminating’, ‘lying and ruminating’, ‘walking’, and ‘walking and grazing’. The performances of the two classifiers towards identification of different cattle activities were compared in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, the importance of using a temperature sensor and a GPS module in addition to an accelerometer in cattle activity recognition could be justified. An overall classification accuracy as high as ~97% was achieved using the XGBoost based classifier. In addition, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity for standing (0.98, 0.97, 0.97, 0.98), lying (0.97, 0.90, 1, 0.96), standing and ruminating (0.99, 1, 0.97, 1), lying and ruminating (0.99, 1, 0.83, 1), walking (1, 1, 1, 1), and walking and grazing (0.99, 1, 0.75, 1) shows the suitability of the proposed method in effective cattle activity monitoring. Since cattle activity states are indicative of various factors such as estrous and several diseases like mastitis, foot-and-mouth disease, etc, the MOOnitor may be used for early detection of these conditions in addition to general health monitoring. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Cattle activity; IoT in agriculture; Multi-sensor fusion; Precision livestock","Accelerometers; Decision trees; Global positioning system; Global system for mobile communications; Internet of things; Temperature sensors; Walking aids; Activity monitoring; Cattle activity; Dairy cattles; Intelligent devices; IoT in agriculture; Multi-sensor fusion; Multi-Sensory; Precision livestock; System modules; Well being; Agriculture",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121254037

In typical deployment scenarios involving low-cost and low-power IoT devices, many communication features are disabled, consequently affecting the security offered by ZigBee. The ZigBee specification assumes that deployment of frame counters is sufficient to mitigate replay attacks in secure ZigBee networks. However, we demonstrate that it is insufficient in this paper (i.e., the network is no longer secure after the coordinator restarts). As a countermeasure, we present a timestamp-based scheme to mitigate replay attacks. Our mitigation strategy does not consume power significantly, and fully powered devices will be responsible for providing power-constrained devices with the current timestamp.

Recommender systems provide useful and customized information, properly selected and filtered, for users and services.

A similarity rule, based on the assigned vectors, was designed so enabling agents to discriminate among them. A closer positioning (clustering) of only similar agents is achieved. The intelligent positioning allows easy identifying of similar smart objects, thus enabling a fast and effective selection operations.

For achieving the low power consumption in these devices, Non-volatile memory (NVM) devices such as Parameter Random Access Memory (PRAM) and Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Random-Access Memory (STT-RAM) are becoming popular among main memory alternatives in embedded IoT devices because of their features such as high thickness, byte addressability, high scalability and low power intake. Additionally, Non-volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM) is widely adopted to save the data in the embedded IoT devices. NVM, flash memories have a limited lifetime, so it is mandatory to adopt intelligent optimization in managing the NVRAM-based embedded devices using an intelligent controller while considering the endurance issue. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a powerful, lightweight machine learning-based workload-adaptive write schemes of the NVRAM, which can increase the lifetime and reduce the energy consumption of the processors. The proposed system consists of three phases like Workload Characterization, Intelligent Compression and Memory Allocators. These phases are used for distributing the write-cycles to NVRAM, following the energy-time consumption and number of data bytes. The extensive experimentations are carried out using the IoMT (Internet of Medical things) benchmark in which the different endurance factors such as application delay, energy and write-time factors were evaluated and compared with the different existing algorithms. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

However, the serviceability in the smart manufacturing environment is still limited since most of the conventional services are conducted in a passively reactive mode. The knowledge as a service (KaaS) model is hence to be introduced to emphasize the cognitive capability by actively utilizing massive knowledge, where industrial knowledge graph (IKG) plays as the core to generate context-awareness and proactive services for the optimization of serviceability and productivity. Meanwhile, as building IKGs for specific industrial cases is still plagued by the small scale and the lack of continuous enrichment, ensuring the quality and availability of the IKG are still challenging. Aiming to fill this gap with a practical and systematic approach, this paper proposes a generic crowdsourcing approach for continuously evolving the IKG. Through the IKG continuous enrichment approach, IKG-enabled systems indicate the higher value creation ability to utilize knowledge as a kind of service, rather than just a kind of resource. To further illustrate the proposed approach, a case study of a printed circuit board (PCB) processing machine is given with discussions. As an explorative study, future perspectives are also discussed to attract more open and in-depth studies for more robust applications of KaaS and IKG in the IIoT-driven smart manufacturing environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Crowdsourcing; Industrial Internet of Things; Industrial Knowledge Graph; Knowledge-as-a-Service; Smart Manufacturing Service","Crowdsourcing; Internet of things; Knowledge graph; Printed circuit boards; Web services; Industrial knowledge graph; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge-as-a-service; Manufacturing environments; Manufacturing service; Service paradigm; Service-based; Smart manufacturing; Smart manufacturing service; Tools and techniques; Flow control",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120916563

WSN provides ubiquitous access to location, the status of different entities of the environment and data acquisition for long term IoT monitoring. Achieving the high performance of the WSN-IoT network remains to be a real challenge since the deployment of these networks in the large area consumes more power which in turn degrades the performance of the networks. So, developing the robust and QoS (quality of services) aware energy-efficient routing protocol for WSN assisted IoT devices needs its brighter light of research to enhance the network lifetime. This paper proposed a Hybrid Energy Efficient Learning Protocol (HELP). The proposed protocol leverages the multi-tier adaptive framework to minimize energy consumption. HELP works in a two-tier mechanism in which it integrates the powerful Extreme Learning Machines for clustering framework and employs the zonal based optimization technique which works on hybrid Whale-dragonfly algorithms to achieve high QoS parameters. The proposed framework uses the sub-area division algorithm to divide the network area into different zones. Extreme learning machines (ELM) which are employed in this framework categories the Zone’s Cluster Head (ZCH) based on distance and energy. After categorizing the zone’s cluster head, the optimal routing path for an energy-efficient data transfer will be selected based on the new hybrid whale-swarm algorithms. The extensive simulations were carried out using OMNET++-Python user-defined plugins by injecting the dynamic mobility models in networks to make it a more realistic environment. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed HELP is examined against the existing protocols such as LEACH, M-LEACH, SEP, EACRP and SEEP and results show the proposed framework has outperformed other techniques in terms of QoS parameters such as network lifetime, energy, latency. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

However, such IoT based smart industries need internet connectivity and interoperability which makes them susceptible to numerous cyber-attacks due to the scarcity of computational resources of IoT devices and communication over insecure wireless channels. Therefore, this necessitates the design of an efficient security mechanism for IIoT environment. In this paper, we propose a hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC) based IIoT Certificateless Signcryption (IIoT-CS) scheme, with the aim of improving security while lowering computational and communication overhead in IIoT environment. HECC with 80-bit smaller key and parameters sizes offers similar security as elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) with 160-bit long key and parameters sizes. We assessed the IIoT-CS scheme security by applying formal and informal security evaluation techniques. We used Real or Random (RoR) model and the widely used automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) simulation tool for formal security analysis and proved that the IIoT-CS scheme provides resistance to various attacks. Our proposed IIoT-CS scheme is relatively less expensive compared to the current state-of-the-art in terms of computational cost and communication overhead.

Therefore, manufacturing new high-performance flexible thermoelectric devices is still a huge challenge. In this work, polyimide/copper (PI/Cu) substrate was deposited by electron deposition technology. The flexible thermoelectric thin film device was fabricated by bonding N-type and P-type bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) slurries onto the PI/Cu substrate. Then, the PDMS film was coated on the device to make the device waterproof and oxidation resistant. The output voltage and maximum power of this device, at the temperature of 80 K, reach 97.5 mV and 60 uW, respectively. After 200 cycles of cyclic bending experiments, 90% high conductivity retention can be maintained.

The users of the fitness system are increasing at a high rate thus the gym providers are constantly extending the fitness facilities. Thus, scheduling such a huge number of requests for fitness exercise is a big challenge. Secondly, the user fitness data is critical thus securing the user fitness data from unauthorized access is also challenging. To overcome these issues, this work proposed a blockchain-based load-balanced task scheduling approach. A thorough analysis has been performed to investigate the applications of IoT in the fitness industry and various scheduling approaches. The proposed scheduling approach aims to schedule the requests of the fitness users in a load-balanced way that maximize the acceptance rate of the users’ requests and improve resource utilization. The performance of the proposed task scheduling approach is compared with the state-of-the-art approaches concerning the average resource utilization and task rejection ratio. The obtained results confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheduling approach.

Considering networks to be a type of graph, this concept was redefined as metric dimension of a graph which is the minimum number of nodes needed to identify all the nodes of the graph. This idea was extended to the concept of edge metric dimension of a graph G, which is the minimum number of nodes needed in a graph to uniquely identify each edge of the network.

In particular the need for automating the process of real-time food item identification, there is a huge surge of research so as to make smarter refrigerators. According to a survey by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), it has been found that 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted by consumers around the world due to either food spoilage or expiry and a large amount of food is wasted from homes and restaurants itself. Smart refrigerators have been very successful in playing a pivotal role in mitigating this problem of food wastage. But a major issue is the high cost of available smart refrigerators and the lack of accurate design algorithms which can help achieve computer vision in any ordinary refrigerator. To address these issues, this work proposes an automated identification algorithm for computer vision in smart refrigerators using InceptionV3 and MobileNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. The designed module and algorithm have been elaborated in detail and are considerably evaluated for its accuracy using test images on standard fruits and vegetable datasets. A total of eight test cases are considered with accuracy and training time as the performance metric. In the end, real-time testing results are also presented which validates the system's performance. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Multi-agent deep Q-networks (MADQNs) target to enforce a self-learning softwarization, optimize resource allocation policies, and advocate computation offloading decisions. With gathered network conditions and resource states, the proposed agent aims to explore various actions for estimating expected longterm rewards in a particular state observation. In exploration phase, optimal actions for joint resource allocation and offloading decisions in different possible states are obtained by maximum Q-value selections. Action-based virtual network functions (VNF) forwarding graph (VNFFG) is orchestrated to map VNFs towards eFL aggregation server with sufficient communication and computation resources in NFV infrastructure (NFVI). The proposed scheme indicates deficient allocation actions,modifies the VNF backup instances, and reallocates the virtual resource for exploitation phase. Deep neural network (DNN) is used as a value function approximator, and epsilongreedy algorithm balances exploration and exploitation. The scheme primarily considers the criticalities of FL model services and congestion states to optimize long-term policy.

The current research paper designs an Energy Efficient Two-Tier Clustering with Multi-hop Routing Protocol (EETTC-MRP) for IoT networks. The presented EETTC-MRP technique operates on different stages namely, tentative Cluster Head (CH) selection, final CH selection, and routing. In first stage of the proposed EETTC-MRP technique, a type II fuzzy logic-based tentative CH (T2FL-TCH) selection is used. Subsequently, Quantum Group Teaching Optimization Algorithm-based Final CH selection (QGTOA-FCH) technique is deployed to derive an optimum group of CHs in the network. Besides, Political Optimizer based Multihop Routing (PO-MHR) technique is also employed to derive an optimal selection of routes between CHs in the network.

It is more difficult in duty-cycled WSNs because the SNs are active for a limited time and inactive in the remaining time to minimize the energy drain. In this context, we propose a delay-aware data fusion (DADF) approach to the trade-off between the delay and energy while performs the data fusion. Initially, the DADF performing the data fusion operation to avoid duplicating and inconsistent data at each SNs using a simple statistical approach during its active state. Afterward, the sink uses reinforcement learning to identify the best forwarding node of each SN for data communications with minimum delay and energy in duty-cycled WSNs. Each forwarding node operates the data fusion once if it acquires the data from its child nodes.

However, labour and energy consumption costs increase the production cost of the greenhouse by 40–50% approximately. Moreover, the security and authenticity of agriculture data, particularly for yield monitoring and analysis, is also a challenging issue in current greenhouse systems.The greenhouse require optimal parameter settings with controlled environment to produce increase food production. Therefore, slight advancement can bring remarkable improvements concerning the increase in production with reduced overall cost. In this work, we contributed blockchain enabled optimization approach for greenhouse system. The proposed approach works in three steps to provide optimal greenhouse environment that are; prediction, optimization, and finally controlling. Initially, the Kalman filter algorithm is employed for predicting the greenhouse sensor data. In next step, the optimal parameters are computed for the indoor greenhouse environment. Finally, the optimized parameters are utilized by the control module to operate and regulate the actuator's state to meet the desired settings in the indoor environment. To evaluate the performance of our proposed greenhouse system, we have developed an emulation tool. The proposed system has been investigated and compared against baseline approach concerning production rate and energy consumption. The obtained results reveal that the proposed optimization approach has improved the energy consumption by 19% against the prediction based approach and 41% against the Baseline scheme. Furthermore, the proof-of-concept based on the Hyperledger Fabric network is implemented on the top of the proposed greenhouse platform. For experimental analysis, we have conducted a series of experiments using Hyperledger calliper concerning throughput, latency, and resource utilization. These results advocates the efficiency of the proposed optimal greenhouse system. © 2021","Agriculture; Blockchain; Greenhouse; Internet of things; Smart contract","Agricultural products; Distributed ledger; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Greenhouses; Internet of things; Agriculture data; Block-chain; Cost-increases; Energy-consumption; Fresh agricultural products; Greenhouse environment; Optimization approach; Production cost; Production rates; Smart applications; Smart contract; agriculture; algorithm; environment; industry; Kalman filter; optimization",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120362071

In this work, IOT is used to train an optimal controller for minimizing wind-induced vibration (WIV) using distributed aerodynamic actuators. Wind tunnel experiments of a scaled cyber–physical aeroelastic building model are used to demonstrate a novel application of the technique. IOT trains a DNN to approximate building vibration at different wind conditions and actuator orientations using an initial set of experiments. After this initial training, a GA uses the DNN to predict actuator orientations that minimize WIV for the given wind condition. A group containing best orientations from the GA and uniform random orientations is used to perform additional experiments and training of the DNN to enhance exploitation and exploration. This process is repeated until the stopping criteria is achieved. This paper includes results of a benchmark study comparing IOT to GA and DNN-GA techniques.

There are massive observations of phenomena at distributed nodes that need to be sent. Due to the low spectrum efficiency, it is a great challenge for orthogonal multi-access (OMA) schemes to transmit such enormous observations in time. To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we propose a joint compressed sensing (CS) measurement scheme for wireless networks to achieve the efficient observation of multiple phenomena. Specifically, all nodes are divided into multiple groups to observe different phenomena, and their observations are sequentially transmitted to the fusion center (FC) through the coherent multiple access channel (MAC). To evaluate the performance, we derive the total achievable rate, which is heavily influenced by the design of coherent transmission and joint CS measurement. Moreover, we compare the joint CS measurement scheme with the traditional scheme based on OMA by deriving the performance gain. It demonstrates the superiority of the proposed scheme.v To maximize the total achievable rate, we study a non-convex optimization problem of the common-component allocation and the time allocation. To solve this intractable problem, we equivalently convert it into a convex optimization problem by studying the non-convex constraint and propose a low-complexity algorithm to provide the optimal solution.

Since the wireless sensor networks refer to networks of embedded IoT devices to provide sensing services with limited energy and storage resources, the energy consumption is an important requirement for communication in IoT applications. Clustering algorithms have been investigated as a technique for energy conservation in networks with scarce resources. The appropriate cluster head balances the load in the network, lowering energy consumption and extending the network lifetime. An energy-saving solution is proposed based on an effective cluster head selection method that assigns cluster heads to nodes based on which have the highest energy level. The proposed algorithm is called Adaptive Dynamic Multi-Hop-Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (ADMH-LEACH). The proposed algorithm is intended for IoT applications in the oil and gas (O&G) industry. The deployment of the adopted algorithm leads to improved field communication, lower maintenance costs, real-time monitoring, digital oil field infrastructure, lower power consumption, increased asset safety and protection, and thus increased productivity. The ADMH-LEACH is based on a variety of variables, including initial energy, residual energy, and energy consumed per round, in order to meet quality-of-service constraints by following service level agreements for O&G IoT applications.

In recent times, different routing protocols have been proposed in the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled UWSN (IoT-UWSNs) to explore the underwater environment for different purposes, that is, scientific and military purposes. However, high energy consumption (EC), end to end (E2E) delay, low packet delivery ratio (PDR) and minimum network lifetime make the energy efficient communication a challenging task in UWSN. The high E2E delay, EC, and reliable data delivery are the critical issues, which play an important role to enhance the network throughput. For effective achievement of EC, proposed a new routing algorithm called bald eagle search (BES). It is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that copied bald eagle hunting behavior. The proposed routing protocol includes three stages: initialization stage, construction stage, and the data transmission phase. The nodes identify the location and the sector during the initialization process. The construction phase includes two steps, neighbor node selection, and identification of energy efficient path. Then the last phase includes the transmission, in this the broadcasting node chooses the nodes with high residual energy (RE) in comparison to the average RE of the entire network. The proposed method is implemented in MATLAB.

RPL employs a customizable objective function to optimize the routing. The default objective functions used in RPL are i) OF0 (Objective Function Zero) and ii) MRHOF (Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective Function). The OF0 is based on the routing metric hop count, whereas the MRHOF uses the ETX metric. They both do not measure the actual link quality. The link quality is directly related to the reliability of the network. The quality of the link can be estimated through methods that are both hardware and software based. The software-based methods are easy to implement and to ensure the reliability of the network. There are different software-based link quality estimation methods; the prominent methods among them are ETX and Link Quality Level (LQL). The ETX is a method of approximation of the transmitted packets. It uses probe packets to predict the expected transmission count, and it may not accurately reflect the link quality. The proposed Link Quality-Based Objective Function (LQBOF) makes use of the LQL metric which provides better link estimation values than the ETX method. The proposed method intends to provide a more reliable routing based on the link quality. The LQL is estimated through a metric called Packet Reception Rate (PRR). The LQL is calculated and ranked as values from 1 to 7, reflecting the best and worst link quality, respectively. The estimated LQL value is linked with the default ETX in computing the best path. This method intends to increase the reliability of the network. The reliability of the objective function is evaluated with the performance metrics packet delivery ratio, power consumption, throughput, convergence time, control traffic overhead and hop count. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Link quality level; Low power and Lossy Networks; Objective function; RPL routing","Internet of things; Low power electronics; Software reliability; Link quality; Link quality level; Lossy networks; Low Power Networks; Minimum rank; Objective functions; Quality levels; Routing-protocol; Routings; RPL routing; Routing protocols",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119498446

Software-defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function are the way to control and configure devices from a centralized location and have been proven to offer scalability and versatility to their deployed ecosystems. In this paper, we systematically review the adoption of SDN and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) for securing the IoT network from emerging threats. To this extent, we provide a comprehensive survey on security solutions based on SDN, Blockchain, NFV, and SDN/NFV proposed for the security of the IoT network. We have also identified open challenges in this domain which includes lack of standardization, low cost, and effective machine learning systems for identifying malicious traffic and handling great attack surface and different attack vectors. The deployed technologies exhibit positive strides in their usage for the provision of security in IoT environments offering security enhancements, scalability, and versatility. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Health risks; Home health care; Internet of things; Learning systems; Network function virtualization; Network security; Scalability; Security systems; Surveys; Transfer functions; Virtual reality; Internet of thing security; Internet technology; Network virtualization; Secure software; Security threats; Smart devices; Smart manufacturing; Smarter machines; Software-defined networks; Surrounding environment; Software defined networking",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119276192

To release the pressure of data management and storage, more and more enterprises and individuals prefer to integrate cloud service with IoT systems, in which the IoT data can be outsourced to cloud server. Since cloud service provider (CSP) is not fully trusted, a variety of methods have been proposed to deal with the problem of data integrity checking. In traditional data integrity audition schemes, the task of data auditing is usually performed by Third Party Auditor (TPA) which is assumed to be trustful. However, in real-life TPA is not trusted as people thought. Therefore, these schemes suffer from the underlying problem of single-point failure. Moreover, most of the traditional schemes are designed by RSA or bilinear map techniques which consume heavy computation and communication cost. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel data integrity checking scheme for cloud-IoT data based on blockchain technique and homomorphic hash. In our scheme, the tags of all data blocks are computed by a homomorphic hash function and stored in blockchain. Moreover, each step within the process of data integrity checking is signed by the performer, and the signatures are stored in blockchain through smart contracts. As a result, each behavior for data integrity checking in our scheme can be traced and audited which improves the security of the scheme greatly. Furthermore, batch-audition for multiple data challenges is also supported in our scheme. We formalize the system model of our scheme and give the concrete construction. Detailed performance analyses demonstrate that our proposed scheme is efficient and practical without the trust-assumption of TPA. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

This concept is the so-called Social Internet of Things (SIot). The evolving nature of edge-cloud computing has enabled storage of a large volume of data from various sources, and this task demands an efficient storage procedure. For this kind of large volume of data storage, the usage of data replication using edge with geo-distributed cloud service area is suited to fulfill the user’s expectations with low latency. The major issue is the way to store the data and replicate these large data items optimally and allocate the request from the data center efficiently. For efficient storage of these data, we use edge server, which is part of the cloud server, in this study. Thus, the data are distributed and stored with quick access, which will reduce the latency with response. The proposed data placement approach learns with machine learning (ML) algorithm called radial basis kernel function assisted with support vector machine (RBF-SVM) to classify the data center for storing the user and friend’s data from the SIoT devices. These learning algorithms will be used to predict the workload of the data stored in the data center as either edge or cloud depending on the existing time slots. The data placement with dynamic nature is also optimized using the proposed dynamic graph partitioning (GP) method to meet the individual user’s demand of low latency with minimum costs. This way will keep the SIoT data placement efficient and effective over time. Accordingly, this proposed data placement and replication approach introduces three kinds of innovations compared with the existing data placement approach. (i) Rather than storing the user data in a single cloud, this study uses the edge server closest to the SIoT devices for faster access with reduced response time. (ii) The classification algorithm called RBF-SVM is used to find storage for user for reducing data replication. (iii) Dynamic GP is introduced for data placement with reduced latency and minimum cost to fulfil the dynamic nature of the SN. The simulation result of this approach obtains reduced latency of 130 ms and minimum cost compared with those of the existing data placement approaches. Therefore, our proposed data placement with ML-based learning on edge provides promising results in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and performance with reduced latency and minimum cost. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

For collaboration between IoT devices and edge cloud servers, edge server nodes provide the computation and storage capabilities for IoT devices through the task offloading process for accelerating tasks with large resource requests. However, the quantitative impact of different offloading architectures and policies on IoT applications’ performance remains far from clear, especially with a dynamic and unpredictable range of connected physical and virtual devices. To this end, this work models the performance impact by exploiting a potential latency that exhibits within the environment of edge cloud. Also, it investigates and compares the effects of loosely-coupled (LC) and orchestrator-enabled (OE) architecture. The LC scheme can smoothly address task redistribution with less time consumption for the offloading sceneries with small scale and small task requests. Moreover, the OE scheme not only outperforms the LC scheme in the large-scale tasks requests and offloading occurs but also reduces the overall time by 28.19%. Finally, to achieve optimized solutions for optimal offloading placement with different constraints, orchestration is important. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

This cutting-edge technology enables individuals to track and control their integrated environment in real-time and remotely via a thousands of IoT devices comprised of sensors and actuators that actively participate in sensing, processing, storing and sharing information. Nonetheless, IoT devices are frequently deployed in hostile environments, wherein adversaries attempt to capture them in order to seize control of the entire network. One such example of potentially malicious behaviour is the cloning of IoT devices, in which an attacker can physically capture the devices, obtain some sensitive information, duplicate the devices, and intelligently deploy them in desired locations to conduct various insider attacks. A device cloning attack on IoT networks is a significant security concern since it allows for selective forwarding, sink-hole, black-hole, and warm-hole attacks. To address this issue, this paper provides an efficient scheme for detecting clone node attack on mobile IoT networks that uses semantic information of IoT devices known as context information to locate them securely. We design the location proof mechanism by combining location proofs and batch verification of the extended elliptic curve digital signature technique (ECDSA*) to accelerate the verification process at selected trusted nodes. Furthermore, we present a model for selecting trustworthy IoT devices based on their profile capabilities, enabling them to be chosen from the other IoT devices for the location proof-verification procedure.

Moreover, scaling laws for transmit powers and RF hardware impairments are established when the number of antennas, M, at the relay grows infinity. It is revealed that, as M increases, the system can yield a non-vanishing rate while cutting down the transmit powers of the IoT devices and relay, and/or scaling up the RF impairments of the relay. The power allocation scheme for maximizing the sum rate is proposed.

As the data computation intensifies, edge computing becomes difficult. Therefore, mobile fog computing is used for reducing traffic and the time for data computation in the network. In previous studies, software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) were used separately in edge computing. Current industrial and academic research is tackling to integrate SDN and NFV in different environments to address the challenges in performance, reliability, and scalability. SDN/NFV is still in development. The traditional Internet of things (IoT) data analysis system is only based on a linear and time-variant system that needs an IoT data system with a high-precision model. This paper proposes a combined architecture of SDN and NFV on an edge node server for IoT devices to reduce the computational complexity in cloud-based fog computing. SDN provides a generalization structure of the forwarding plane, which is separated from the control plane. Meanwhile, NFV concentrates on virtualization by combining the forwarding model with virtual network functions (VNFs) as a single or chain of VNFs, which leads to interoperability and consistency. The orchestrator layer in the proposed software-defined NFV is responsible for handling real-time tasks by using an edge node server through the SDN controller via four actions: task creation, modification, operation, and completion. Our proposed architecture is simulated on the EstiNet simulator, and total time delay, reliability, and satisfaction are used as evaluation parameters. The simulation results are compared with the results of existing architectures, such as software-defined unified virtual monitoring function and ASTP, to analyze the performance of the proposed architecture.

Heterogeneous objects of real world are enhanced with capability to communicate, computing capabilities and standards to interoperate with existing network and these entities are resource constrained and vulnerable to various security attacks. Huge number of research works are being carried out to analyze various possible attacks and to propose standards for securing communication between devices in internet of things (IoT). In this article, a robust and lightweight authentication scheme for mutual authentication between client and server using constrained application protocol is proposed. Internet of things enables devices with different characteristics and capabilities to be integrated with internet. These heterogeneous devices should interoperate with each other to accumulate, process and transmit data for facilitating smart services. The growth of IoT applications leads to the rapid growth of IoT devices incorporated to the global network and network traffic over the traditional network. This scheme greatly reduces the authentication overhead between the devices by reducing the packet size of messages, number of messages transmitted and processing overhead on communicating devices. Efficiency of this authentication scheme against attacks such as DoS (denial of service), replay attacks and attacks to exhaust the resources are also examined.

There is broad consensus that these systems will play a vital role in the achievement of economic growth in numerous growth countries. Among the major challenges preventing the fast and widespread adoption of such systems is the failure to maintain the data privacy of patients and the integrity of remote clinical diagnostics. Recently, the author proposed an end-to-end authentication scheme for healthcare IoT systems (E2EA), to provide a mutual authentication with a high data rate between the communication nodes of the healthcare IoT systems. Although the E2EA authentication scheme supports numerous attractive security services to resist various types of attack, there is an ambiguous view of the impact of the desynchronization attack on the E2EA authentication scheme. In general, the performance of the authentication scheme is considered a critical issue when evaluating the applicability of such schemes, along with the security services that can be achieved. Therefore, this paper discusses how the E2EA authentication scheme can resist the desynchronization attack through all possible attack scenarios. Additionally, the effect of the desynchronization attack on the E2EA scheme performance is analyzed in terms of its computation and communication costs, based on a comparison with the recently related authentication schemes that can prevent such attack. Moreover, this research paper finds that the E2EA authentication scheme can not only prevent the desynchronization attack, but also offers a low cost in terms of computations and communications, and can maintain consistency and synchronization between the communication nodes of the healthcare IoT systems during the next authentication sessions. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

This paper presents the design and implementation process of such an IoT-based solution for low-cost and scalable water quality monitoring applications. To achieve that end, we propose the utilization of a low-cost inter-digital capacitance (IDC) sensor to characterize the conductivity of the water, a very telling parameter about the level of pollution in the water. Additionally, an embedded method to measure such sensor was designed and implemented, which considers the requirements of a portable platform: low computational capabilities, small memory and low power consumption. Our results show that an IDC sensor is capable of detecting the changes of the capacitance of the sample, and therefore mapping the changes in the conductivity of the water. Additionally, integrating an embedded measuring method is a valid option for in-situ characterization of water samples and the complete solution enables a new paradigm for water quality monitoring in large scale scenarios. © 2022, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

Among various attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs), backdoor attacks are generally recognized as the most imperceptible type, where an attacker can upload a poisoned DNN model that misbehaves only when inputs contain specific triggers. Existing defense solutions assume a defender has prior knowledge of backdoor triggers or DNN models, remaining far away from practical and flexible. To this end, this paper proposes a collaborative deep learning microservice, CoDefend, which employs strong intentional perturbation (STRIP) and cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to defend against backdoored neural networks.

To reduce the energy used by idle listening, a low-duty cycle is often used in an event-sparse wireless sensor network. However, low-duty cycles bring large end-to-end delays. In this paper, a listen interval adaptive adjustment (LIAA) scheme is proposed to adjust the listen interval (LI) of a node to reduce end-to-end delays while maintaining the long lifetime of a network. The key idea is to make full use of the energy consumption imbalance in a network, to allow nodes away from the sink to use the residual energy to add listen intervals. The LIAA scheme has 3 sub-strategies. One is the basic add listen interval (BALI) strategy, in which the parent node adds listen intervals in the fixed active slots of its child nodes. Another strategy is the consecutive listen (CL) scheme, which is based on BALI, and listen intervals are added consecutively. The third strategy is the random add listen interval (RALI) scheme, which uses the idea of randomness to add listen intervals. The extensive theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the LIAA scheme proposed in this paper has better performance. Compared with the traditional scheme, the delays in the BALI scheme, CL scheme and RALI scheme were reduced by 24.03%, 23.45% and 39.41%, respectively, while the lifetime of the network was maintained. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Delay; Duty cycle; Energy saving; Lifetime; Listen interval adaptive adjustment; Sensor based system","Energy utilization; Internet of things; Sensor nodes; Adaptive adjustment; Delay; Duty-cycle; Energy savings; Energy-savings; Lifetime; Listen interval adaptive adjustment; Low duty-cycles; Low-duty cycles; Sensor based systems; Energy conservation",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118827032

A large amount of data has higher requirements on the transmission protocol in the network. Most of the existing research focuses on studying a single node as the basic information transmission unit. However, social networks have complex topological structures, and such methods are difficult to grasp the evolutionary rules of the network. It usually leads to higher resource waste and problem complexity. A triad (a network subgraph containing three nodes) can not only provide accurate local topology information, but also its conversion rules are easy to describe, which can reduce the complexity of the problem. The mutual conversion between triads constitutes the evolution of the entire network. Based on this, this article first proposes a triad-based social network evolution analysis method (SNEA). SNEA includes a prediction algorithm (TPMPA) that learns the evolution of the triad transition probability matrix through time series and a quantization algorithm (TTHQA) that quantifies the impact of triad transformations on the network-based on random walks. SNEA integrates the advantages of the two algorithms to dynamically grasp the evolutionary rules of the network. Then this paper proposes a triad link prediction algorithm (TLPA) to quantitatively evaluate the results of the evolution analysis of the SNEA method. The TLPA algorithm reduces the blindness of message forwarding and unnecessary waste of resources by predicting the probability of a connection between nodes in the network. Experimental results show that compared with Epidemic, SECM, CRDNT, ICMT algorithms, our method has a prominent advantage in improving message delivery rate and reducing resource consumption. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Delivery rate; Evolutionary analysis; Link prediction; Opportunistic social network; Triad","Complex networks; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Internet of things; Linear transformations; Random processes; Social networking (online); Topology; Analysis method; Delivery rate; Evolution analysis; Evolutionary analyse; Evolutionary rules; Link prediction; Opportunistic social network; Prediction algorithms; Social network evolution; Triad; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118752868

Specifically, we first investigate the traffic forwarding process in an SDIoT network, i.e., routing and flow rule placement tasks. We design a cost function for the routing to set up traffic flow paths in the data plane. Next, we propose an adaptive flow rule placement approach to maximize the number of match-fields in a flow rule at SDN switches. To deal with the dynamics of IoT traffic flows, we model the system operation by using the Markov decision process (MDP) with a continuous action space and formulate its optimization problem. Subsequently, we develop a deep deterministic policy gradient-based algorithm to help the system obtain the optimal policy. The evaluation results demonstrate that DeepPlace can efficiently maintain a significant number of match-fields in a flow rule, i.e., approximately 86% of the maximum level, while minimizing the QoS violation ratio of traffic flows, i.e., 6.7%, in a highly dynamic traffic scenario, which outperforms three other existing solutions, i.e., FlowMan, FlowStat, and DeepMatch. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Deep reinforcement learning; Flow rule placement; Internet of Things; Quality-of-Service; Software-Defined Networking","Cost functions; Deep learning; Internet of things; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Software defined networking; Adaptive flows; Data planes; Data-plane; Fine grained; Flow rule placement; Flow rules; Quality-of-service; Software-defined networkings; Traffic analysis; Traffic flow; Quality of service",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118725283

Based on the spatio-temporal correlation between multivariate time-series data, we developed a novel multivariate time-series data encoding scheme utilizing the proposed time-series distance measure textit ADMWD. Composed of two significant factors for a multivariate time-series prediction, i.e., the absolute deviation from the mean (ADM) and the weighted differential (WD) distance, the textit ADMWD considers both the time distance from a prediction point and a negative correlation between the time-series data concurrently. Utilizing the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a subset of IoT sensor readings can be predicted from encoded multivariate time-series measurements, and we compared the predicted sensor values with actual readings to obtain the adaptive data transmission period. Extensive performance evaluations show a substantial performance gain of the proposed algorithm in terms of the average power reduction ratio (approximately 12%) and average data reconstruction error (approximately 8.32% MAPE).

Since IoT devices generate a massive quantity of digital media, it is therefore required to save the media, especially images, in a secure way.

Enhanced pest attacks on crops are one of the major impacts on sustainable developments in agriculture to come up with the needs of the ever-increasing human population. Early warning of a pest attack is important for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) activities to be effective. Early warning of pest attacks is also important for judicious use of pesticides for efficient use of resources for minimal impacts on the environment. Sugarcane is the major cash crop and is also severely affected by different types of pests. This study proposed stem borer attack prediction on sugarcane crops by directly sensed environment conditions from the crop field using the Internet of Things (IoT).

As classical WSN faces several issues in service-based IoT applications, fog computing has been introduced in real-time, enabling local data processing and avoid raw data transmission to cloud servers. The Fog-based WSN generally involves advanced nodes, normal nodes, and some Fog Nodes (FN). Though the Fog-based WSN offers several benefits, there is a need to develop an effective trust-based secure routing protocol for data transmission among Cluster Heads (CHs) and FNs. In this view, this paper presents a Quantum Firefly Optimization based Multi-Objec-tive Secure Routing (QFO-MOSR) protocol for Fog-based WSN. The main inten-tion of the QFO-MOSR technique is to derive an optimal selection of routes between CHs and FNs in the network. The QFO-MOSR technique has incorpo-rated the concepts of quantum computing and Firefly (FF) optimization algorithm inspired by the flashing behaviour of FFs. In addition, a multi-objective fitness function is derived by the QFO-MOSR technique using seven objectives: dis-tance, inter-cluster distance, energy, delay, intra-cluster distance, link lifetime, and trust. The proposed routing technique derives a fitness function including trust factor from ensuring security. The design of the QFO-MOSR technique with a multi-objective fitness function shows the novelty of the work. To validate the performance of the QFO-MOSR technique, a series of experiments were carried out, and the results are investigated in terms of different measures. The experimental analysis ensured that the QFO-MOSR technique is superior to other methods in terms of different measures. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

To prevent accidents, several low-cost hypovigilance (hypo-V) systems were developed in the past based on a multimodal-hybrid (physiological and behavioral) feature set. Similarly in this paper, real-time driver inattention and fatigue (Hypo-Driver) detection system is proposed through multi-view cameras and biosignal sensors to extract hybrid features. The considered features are derived from non-intrusive sensors that are related to the changes in driving behavior and visual facial expressions. To get enhanced visual facial features in uncontrolled environment, three cameras are deployed on multiview points (0°, 45°, and 90°) of the drivers. To develop a Hypo-Driver system, the physiological signals (electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electro-myography (sEMG), and electrooculography (EOG)) and behavioral information (PERCLOS70-80-90%, mouth aspect ratio (MAR), eye aspect ratio (EAR), blinking frequency (BF), head-titled ratio (HT-R)) are collected and pre-processed, then followed by feature selection and fusion techniques. The driver behaviors are classified into five stages such as normal, fatigue, visual inattention, cognitive inattention, and drowsy. This improved hypo-Driver system utilized trained behavioral features by a convolutional neural network (CNNs), recurrent neural network and long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM)model is used to extract physiological features. After fusion of these features, the Hypo-Driver system is classified hypo-V into five stages based on trained layers and dropout-layer in the deep-residual neural network (DRNN) model. To test the performance of a hypo-Driver system, data from 20 drivers are acquired. The results of Hypo-Driver compared to state-of-theart methods are presented. Compared to the state-of-the-art Hypo-V system, on average, the Hypo-Driver system achieved a detection accuracy (AC) of 96.5%. The obtained results indicate that the Hypo-Driver system based on multimodal and multiview features outperforms other state-of-the-art driver Hypo-V systems by handling many anomalies. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

In this paper, we design a novel detector, dubbed as PU-Net, that dynamically learns the PU activity patterns in a cognitive 5G smart city, where a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is deployed as flying base stations to serve the Internet-of-Things (IoT) users. Unlike the traditional schemes, the PU-Net is free from signal-noise model assumptions and is leveraged through deep residual learning integrated with atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to sense the PU's transmitted signal patterns in the network. The PU-Net detects and classifies the active and idle PU states by exploiting the multilevel spatial-temporal features in the signal and noise frames. The proposed model is trained using locally synthesized Rayleigh channel-impaired data with large variability of modulated signals and different noise floor regimes. Additionally, the PU-Net model is blind-tested and evaluated on real-world over-the-air signals and with variable-length frames and varying channel effects at secondary users (SUs). With extensive experiments, it is shown that PU-Net outperforms other benchmark detectors, obtaining an accuracy of 0.9974, with 0.9978 recall and 0.9970 precision in detecting and classifying the PU transmitted signal patterns.

Financial crisis prediction (FCP) is an essential topic in business sector that finds it useful to identify the financial condition of a financial institution. At the same time, the development of the internet of things (IoT) has altered the mode of human interaction with the physical world. The IoT can be combined with the FCP model to examine the financial data from the users and perform decision making process. This paper presents a novel multi-objective squirrel search optimization algorithm with stacked autoencoder (MOSSA-SAE)model for FCP in IoT environment. The MOSSA-SAE model encompasses different subprocesses namely preprocessing, class imbalance handling, parameter tuning, and classification. Primarily, the MOSSA-SAE model allows the IoT devices such as smartphones, laptops, etc., to collect the financial details of the users which are then transmitted to the cloud for further analysis. In addition, SMOTE technique is employed to handle class imbalance problems. The goal of MOSSA in SMOTE is to determine the oversampling rate and area of nearest neighbors of SMOTE. Besides, SAE model is utilized as a classification technique to determine the class label of the financial data. At the same time, the MOSSA is applied to appropriately select the 'weights' and 'bias' values of the SAE. An extensive experimental validation process is performed on the benchmark financial dataset and the results are examined under distinct aspects. The experimental values ensured the superior performance of the MOSSA-SAE model on the applied dataset. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Cognitive radio (CR) technology is characterized as the best aspirant forwireless communications to augment IoT competencies. In theCR networks, secondary users (SUs) opportunistically get access to the primary users (PUs) spectrum through spectrum sensing. The multipath issues in the wireless channel can fluster the sensing ability of the individual SUs.Therefore, several cooperative SUs are engaged in cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) to ensure reliable sensing results. In CSS, security is still a major concern for the researchers to safeguard the fusion center (FC) against abnormal sensing reports initiated by the malicious users (MUs). In this paper, butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA)-based soft decision method is proposed to find an optimized weighting coefficient vector correlated to the SUs sensing notifications. The coefficient vector is utilized in the soft decision rule at the FC before making any global decision. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is compared for a variety of parameters with existing schemes through simulation results.

Due to the similarity in initial symptoms with viral fever, it is challenging to identify this virus initially. Non-detection of this virus at the early stage results in the death of the patient. Developing and densely populated countries face a scarcity of resources like hospitals, ventilators, oxygen, and healthcareworkers. Technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence can play a vital role in diagnosing the COVID-19 virus at an early stage. To minimize the spread of the pandemic, IoT-enabled devices can be used to collect patient's data remotely in a secure manner. Collected data can be analyzed through a deep learning model to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus. In this work, the authors have proposed a three-phase model to diagnose covid-19 by incorporating a chatbot, IoT, and deep learning technology. In phase one, an artificially assisted chatbot can guide an individual by asking about some common symptoms. In case of detection of even a single sign, the second phase of diagnosis can be considered, consisting of using a thermal scanner and pulse oximeter. In case of high temperature and low oxygen saturation levels, the third phase of diagnosis will be recommended, where chest radiography images can be analyzed through an AI-based model to diagnose the presence of the COVID-19 virus in the human body.

Due to more and more online security and data hijacking attacks, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data are considered serious issues in HIoT applications. In this regard, lightweight block ciphers (LBCs) are promising in resourceconstrained environment where security is the primary consideration. The prevalent challenge while designing an LBC for the HIoT environment is how to ascertain platform performance, cost, and security. Most of the existing LBCs primarily focus on text data or grayscale images. The main focus of this paper is about securing color images in a cost-effective way.We emphasis high confidentiality of color images captured by cameras in resource-constrained smartphones, and high confidentiality of sensitive images transmitted by low-power sensors in IoT systems. In order to reduce computational complexity and simulation time, the proposed Lightweight Symmetric Block Cipher (LSBC) exploits chaos-based confusion-diffusion operations at the inter-block level using a single round. The strength of LSBC is assessed by cryptanalysis, while it is ranked by comparing it to other privacy-preserving schemes.

Two of the most important challenges to be addressed concern the protection of smart objects and the need to guarantee them a great autonomy. For this purpose, the definition of trust and reputation mechanisms appears crucial. At the same time, several researchers have started to adopt a common distributed ledger, such as a Blockchain, for building advanced solutions in the IoT. However, due to the high dimensionality of this problem, enabling a trust and reputation mechanism by leveraging a Blockchain-based technology could give rise to several performance issues in the IoT. In this paper, we propose a two-tier Blockchain framework to increase the security and autonomy of smart objects in the IoT by implementing a trust-based protection mechanism. In this framework, smart objects are suitably grouped into communities. To reduce the complexity of the solution, the first-tier Blockchain is local and is used only to record probing transactions performed to evaluate the trust of an object in another one of the same community or of a different community. Periodically, after a time window, these transactions are aggregated and the obtained values are stored in the second-tier Blockchain. Specifically, stored values are the reputation of each object inside its community and the trust of each community in the other ones of the framework. In this paper, we describe in detail our framework, its behavior, the security model associated with it and the tests carried out to evaluate its correctness and performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Autonomy; Blockchain; Internet of Things; Protection; Reliability; Reputation; Trust","Blockchain; Trusted computing; Autonomy; Block-chain; Protection; Reputation; Reputation mechanism; Smart objects; Trust; Trust and reputation; Trust mechanism; Two tiers; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118562923

Several shortcomings of a network system can be leveraged by an attacker to get unauthorized access through malicious traffic. Safeguard from such attacks requires an efficient automatic system that can detect malicious traffic timely and avoid system damage. Currently, many automated systems can detect malicious activity, however, the efficacy and accuracy need further improvement to detect malicious traffic from multi-domain systems. The present study focuses on the detection of malicious traffic with high accuracy using machine learning techniques. The proposed approach used two datasets UNSW-NB15 and IoTID20 which contain the data for IoT-based traffic and local network traffic, respectively. Both datasets were combined to increase the capability of the proposed approach in detecting malicious traffic from local and IoT networks, with high accuracy. Horizontally merging both datasets requires an equal number of features which was achieved by reducing feature count to 30 for each dataset by leveraging principal component analysis (PCA).

These IoT devices are connected to a network therefore prone to attacks. Various management tasks and network operations such as security, intrusion detection, Quality-of-Service provisioning, performance monitoring, resource provisioning, and traffic engineering require traffic classification. Due to the ineffectiveness of traditional classification schemes, such as port-based and payload-based methods, researchers proposed machine learning-based traffic classification systems based on shallow neural networks. Furthermore, machine learning-based models incline to misclassify internet traffic due to improper feature selection. In this research, an efficient multilayer deep learning based classification system is presented to overcome these challenges that can classify internet traffic. To examine the performance of the proposed technique,Moore-dataset is used for training the classifier. The proposed scheme takes the pre-processed data and extracts the flow features using a deep neural network (DNN). In particular, themaximumentropy classifier is used to classify the internet traffic. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid deep learning algorithm is effective and achieved high accuracy for internet traffic classification, i.e., 99.23%.

To realize the promised potentials, advanced resource allocation design plays a decisive role in revealing, understanding, and exploiting the intrinsic rate-energy tradeoff capitalizing on the dual use of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless charging and communication. In this article, we provide a comprehensive tutorial overview of SWIPT from the perspective of resource allocation design. The fundamental concepts, system architectures, and RF energy harvesting (EH) models are introduced. In particular, three commonly adopted EH models, namely, the linear EH model, the nonlinear saturation EH model, and the nonlinear circuit-based EH model, are characterized and discussed. Then, for a typical wireless system setup, we establish a generalized resource allocation design framework that subsumes conventional resource allocation design problems as special cases. Subsequently, we elaborate on relevant tools from optimization theory and exploit them for solving representative resource allocation design problems for SWIPT systems with and without perfect channel state information (CSI) available at the transmitter, respectively. The associated technical challenges and insights are also highlighted.

At the same time, 6G network can take real-world intelligent decisions and implement automated equipment operations. But the inclusion of different technologies into the system increased its energy consumption for which appropriate measures need to be taken. This has become mandatory for optimal resource allocation in 6G-enabled industrial applications. In this scenario, the current research paper introduces a new metaheuristic resource allocation strategy for clusterbased 6G industrial applications, named MRAS-CBIA technique. MRASCBIA technique aims at accomplishing energy efficiency and optimal resource allocation in 6G-enabled industrial applications. The proposed MRAS-CBIR technique involves three major processes. Firstly, Weighted Clustering Technique (WCT) is employed to elect the optimal Cluster Heads (CHs) or coordinating agents with the help of three parameters namely, residual energy, distance, and node degree. Secondly, Decision Tree-based Location Prediction (DTLP)mechanism is applied to determine the exact location ofManagement Agent (MA). Finally, Fuzzy C-means with Tunicate SwarmAlgorithm (FCMTSA) is used for optimal resource allocation in 6G industrial applications. The performance of the proposed MRAS-CBIA technique was validated and the results were examined under different dimensions.

The pivotal functions of the 6LoWPAN protocol stack enable comprehensive integration of such networks from wearable wireless sensor networks (W-WSN) to IoHT, as TCP/IP does not suffice the requirements of IoHT networks. As a result, the congestion in the IoHT network increases with a growing number of devices, resulting in loss of critical medical information due to buffer loss and channel loss, which is unacceptable. In this paper, we explored different applications of patient-centric IoHT architectures to draw a realistic resource-limited topological layout of IoHT for congestion estimation. After critically reviewing existing congestion schemes for 6LoWPANs, we proposed an effective buffer-loss estimation model based on the Queuing Theory to determine the number of packets lost at the node's buffer. The buffer is modeled as an M/M/1/K Markov Chain Queue. The M/M/1/K Queue equilibrium equation is used to establish a relationship between the probabilities of the buffer being empty or completely filled. We derived the expressions for total buffer-loss probability and expected mean packet delay for the resource-constraint IoHT network. Furthermore, to validate the buffer-loss estimation, an analytical model is used to compare buffer-loss probabilities, the number of packets dropped at leaf/intermediate nodes and the number of packets successfully received at the local sink node. The results show a close correlation between both the models on varying values of the number of leaf nodes, buffer size, offered packet load and available channel capacity. Thus, in resource-restrictive IoHT, the proposed model performs better than two related works. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Buffer-loss; Buffer-overflow; Congestion control; IoHT congestion; IoT Healthcare; Packet-loss estimation","Health care; Markov processes; Packet loss; Queueing theory; Sensor nodes; Wearable technology; 6LoWPAN; Buffer overflows; Buffer-loss; Congestion control; Internet of healthcare thing congestion; IoT healthcare; Loss estimation; Loss probability; Non-wearables; Packet loss estimations; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118493440

On the other side the proliferation of these devices will soon cause radio spectrum shortage. So, to facilitate these networks, we integrate Cognitive Radio (CR) functionality in these networks. CR can sense the unutilized spectrum of licensed users and then use these empty bands when required. In order to keep the IoT nodes functional all time, continuous energy is required. For this reason the energy harvested techniques are preferred in IoT networks. Mainly it is preferred to harvest Radio Frequency (RF) energy in the network. In this paper a region based multi-channel architecture is proposed. In which the coverage area of primary node is divided as Energy Harvesting Region and Communication Region. The Secondary User (SU) that are the licensed user is IoT enabledwith Cognitive Radio (CR) techniques so we call it CR-enabled IoT node/device and is encouraged to harvest energy by utilizing radio frequency energy. To harvest energy efficiently and to reduce the energy consumption during sensing, the concept of overlapping region is given that supports to sense multiple channels simultaneously and help the SU to find best channel for transmitting data or to harvest energy from the ideal channel. From the experimental analysis, it is proved that SU can harvest more energy in overlapping region and this architecture proves to consume less energy during data transmission as compared to single channel. We also show that channel load can be highly reduced and channel utilization is proved to be more proficient.

However, such interventions come with immense social and economic costs and the relative effectiveness of different mobility restrictions are not well understood. Some recent works have used telecoms data sources that cover fractions of a population to understand behavioral changes and how these changes have impacted case growth. This study analyzed uniquely comprehensive datasets in order to examine the relationship between mobility and transmission of COVID-19 in the country of Andorra. The data consisted of spatio-temporal telecoms data for all mobile subscribers in the country, serology screening results for 91% of the population, and COVID-19 case reports. A comprehensive set of mobility metrics was developed using the telecoms data to indicate entrances to the country, contact with tourists, stay-at-home rates, trip-making and levels of crowding. Mobility metrics were compared to infection rates across communities and transmission rate over time. All metrics dropped sharply at the start of the country's lockdown and gradually rose again as the restrictions were gradually lifted. Several of these metrics were highly correlated with lagged transmission rate. There was a stronger correlation for measures of indoor crowding and inter-community trip-making, and a weaker correlation for total trips (including intra-community trips) and stay-at-homes rates. These findings provide support for policies which aim to discourage gathering indoors while lifting the most restrictive mobility limitations. © 2013 IEEE.","Cellular phones; geospatial analysis; health and safety; Internet of Things; mobile communication","COVID-19; High resolution; Mobility metric; Mobility pattern; Mobility restrictions; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Pandemic; Scale analysis; Transmission rates; Trip making; Population statistics; Andorra; Article; biomechanics; coronavirus disease 2019; crowding (area); disease surveillance; disease transmission; human; infection rate; lockdown; metapopulation; pandemic; population density; sensitivity and specificity; sociology; telecommunication; tourism; vaccination; walking difficulty; Andorra; communicable disease control; Andorra; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118258009

We assume a non-preemptive scheme applying priorities on the buffer in MC so that the packets with lower priority in the queue can be replaced by more urgent higher priority packets but not in the service, as well. The arrival packets are specified by deadline characteristic due to the great demand for fresh data. The deadline is provided to free the buffer and let the monitoring center be updated by the latest data. As significant parameters in calculating the throughput and freshness of data, Rate of Information (RoI) and system's Age of Information (AoI) are investigated in the MC.

Thus, a Markov model is applied to derive the closed form expressions considering deterministic deadlines and the impact of high and low priority packets. Also, a new metric named the Age to Rate Ratio of Information (ARRoI) is introduced and discussed for better realization of the relation between effective arrival rate and AoI. Simulation results for various parameters confirm the analytical results and show that the newly introduced metric, ARRoI, could be employed in finding proper transmission rates. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Age of Information; Age to Rate Ratio of Information; IoT sensors; Non-preemptive systems; Packet deadline; Priority of arrivals","Markov processes; Packet networks; Age of information; Age to rate ratio of information; IoT sensor; Monitoring centers; Non-preemptive; Non-preemptive system; Packet deadline; Preemptive systems; Priority of arrival; Rate ratios; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118136891

Transition metal oxides have potential for application in SSLIBs due to their high theoretical capacity. In this work, films of mixed nickel and aluminum oxides (NAO) were obtained at a temperature of 300 ℃ by plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (ALD). The growth rates of the films turned out to be higher than the expected ones calculated from the growth rates of monoxide films. The increase in the growth rates is presumably associated with the chemosorption of a larger number of reagent molecules on the film surface during the alternation of reagent pairs during the ALD. High growth per cycle values of alumina lead to higher aluminum content and lower density of NAO films. The phase composition of NAO 50/1 and 75/1 films corresponds to the cubic NiO (Fm-3 m) space group. NAO films have a uniform surface dotted with round and fragmented particles. The electrochemical properties of the obtained films were studied by the cyclic voltammetry and cyclic charge–discharge tests at discharge currents from 0.5 to 60C. With an 80-fold increase in the discharge current, the electrode capacity decreased by 30%. It was shown the presence of aluminum in certain concentrations slows down the growth of pseudocapacitance by 20–28% and does not significantly affect the Coulomb efficiency of the films obtained. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Atomic layer deposition; Li-ion batteries; Nickel aluminum oxides; Solid-state batteries; Thin films","Alumina; Aluminum coatings; Aluminum oxide; Cyclic voltammetry; Electric discharges; Film growth; Growth rate; Internet of things; Lithium compounds; Nickel oxide; Thin film lithium ion batteries; Thin films; Transition metal oxides; Transition metals; Aluminium oxide films; Atomic-layer deposition; Discharges currents; Electrochemical activities; Nickel oxide films; Power supply; SEI formations; Small scale; Solid state lithium ion battery; Thin-films; Atomic layer deposition",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117906269

The 6TiSCH (IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH) protocol stack enables us to schedule the transmissions in TSCH network to achieve application-specific guarantees.

The blocks are repeated in a slotframe to accommodate the retransmissions of packets to ensure reliability and minimise the latency.

Due to its nature and area of operation, IoT systems always work in a constrained environment, with battery depletion, hardware malfunction and harsh wireless channel conditions. For application processing, Cloud computing provided an absolute solution, but its viability is limited by the exorbitant costs and high transmission delays associated with it. In such a scenario, Fog computing is fast emerging as an attractive solution. It focuses on shifting the data processing activities to the edge of the network. However, fog computing has its own share of challenges that needs to be overcome for efficient and effective designs. The computational resources of fog server are so scarce that it cannot respond quickly to the high computational requirements that can cause an unacceptable queuing delay among the IoT applications. Hence, the optimal solution lies in the convergence of the two technologies. In this paper, the energy efficient and delay-aware task allocation problem in an IoT-fog-cloud system is investigated. We formulate a delay-based task allocation problem which suggests the optimal task allocation among local IoT devices, edge server and the cloud toward the minimum energy consumption and end to end delay. The problem is then solved using Energy-efficient task offloading strategy (EETOS) based on Levy-flight moth flame optimization (LMFO) algorithm.

It provides safety and infotainment applications for road users. It relies on the exchange of real-time messages known as beacons to achieve connectivity and ensure safety. The beacons contain the position, the identifier and the velocity of the vehicle. This data can be eavesdropped by a malicious attacker to construct a full trajectory of a target vehicle and track its user. The tracking violates the on-road users’ location privacy. It is the cyber-equivalent of stalking. Its consequences may be directly related to the user’s safety. Therefore, the privacy issue in CE-IoV is crucial and preserving it is a priority.

In a rush for convenience and marketability, the security of these devices is usually less considered during production and even ignored.

Specifically, we summarize the basis of RA. We set up an elaborate adversarial model by systematizing existing RA schemes.

In this regard, it is suggested to quantify the freshness of updates by using Age of Information (AoI) from the receiver's perspective. Specifically, the AoI measures the freshness over time. However, the freshness in the content is neglected. In this paper, we introduce an age-based utility, named as Age of Changed Information (AoCI), which captures both the passage of time and the change of information content. By modeling the underlying physical process as a discrete time Markov chain, we investigate the AoCI in a time-slotted status update system, where a sensor samples the physical process and transmits the update packets to the destination. With the aim of minimizing the weighted sum of the AoCI and the update cost, we formulate an infinite horizon average cost Markov Decision Process. We show that the optimal updating policy has a special structure with respect to the AoCI and identify the condition under which the special structure exists. By exploiting the special structure, we provide a low complexity relative policy iteration algorithm that finds the optimal updating policy. We further investigate the optimal policy for two special cases. In the first case where the state of the physical process transits with equiprobability, we show that optimal policy is of threshold type and derive the closed-form of the optimal threshold. We then study a more generalized periodic Markov model of the physical process in the second case. Lastly, simulation results are laid out to exhibit the performance of the optimal updating policy and its superiority over the zero-wait baseline policy. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","information freshness; Internet of Things; Markov decision processes; structural analysis","Iterative methods; Markov processes; Content-aware; Information contents; Information freshness; Information measures; Markov Decision Processes; Mission critical applications; Optimal policies; Physical process; Special structure; Status updates; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117095157

Because of the public transmission channel, the security and privacy in IoV have paid serious attention. In IoV, it is crucial to generate a secret session key among the various vehicles and road-side units (RSUs) so that they can share the confidential information over the public Internet. Thus, an authenticated key agreement (AKA) protocol should be needed that can achieve the session key requirement in the IoV for secure communication. For this purpose, various AKA techniques has been designed using a number of different tools. Several existing AKA protocols either suffer from different attacks or inefficient for IoV environment due to its excessive communication and computational costs. Many such traditional schemes have used either Diffie–Hellman (DH) or prime factorization type hard problems. These hard problems are vulnerable to the futuristic technologies like quantum computer. Besides, existing quantum resistance AKA protocols use lattice cryptography for its security. However, these protocols either incurs an overhead of certificate management or have excessive communication and computational costs. Hence, there is a need of quantum resistance AKA protocols which removes the certificate overhead and also efficient for the IoV. In this paper, we propose a lattice-based two-party authenticated key agreement (LB-ID-2PAKA) protocol using identity-based cryptography (IBC). The lattice hard problems could resist the quantum computers and IBC could remove the overhead of certificate management. The security strength of proposed LB-ID-2PAKA protocol is analyzed under the random oracle model to show its robustness against the present as well as future quantum attacks. In addition, the resiliency against different security attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, known-key security (K-KS), unknown key-share (UK-S) attack etc. are also included. Further, the performance analysis shows that the proposed LB-ID-2PAKA protocol outperforms the existing protocols and feasible for IoV applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Internet of Vehicles; Key exchange; Lattice-based cryptography; Provable security; Security","Internet of things; Network security; Quantum cryptography; Qubits; Authenticated key agreement; Authenticated key agreement protocols; Communication cost; Hard problems; Internet of vehicle; Key-exchange; Lattice-based cryptography; Provable security; Security; Session key; Vehicles",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117073263

The system also concedes the freedom of a patient. IoT is a part of this system and it helps in providing care to the patients. IoTbased healthcare devices are trustworthy since it almost certainly recognizes the potential intensifications at very early stage and alerts the patients and medical experts to such an extent that they are provided with immediate care. Existing methodologies exhibit few shortcomings in terms of computational complexity, cost and data security. Hence, the current research article examines SHC2 security through Light Weight Cipher (LWC) with Optimal S-Box model in PRESENT cipher. This procedure aims at changing the sub bytes in which a single function is connected with several bytes’ information to upgrade the security level through Swam optimization. The key contribution of this research article is the development of a secure healthcare model for smart city using SHC2 security via LWC and Optimal S-Box models. The study used a nonlinear layer and single 4-bit S box for round configuration after verifying SHC2 information, constrained by Mutual Authentication (MA). The security challenges, in healthcare information systems, emphasize the need for a methodology that immovably concretes the establishments. The methodology should act practically, be an effective healthcare framework that depends on solidarity and adapts to the developing threats. Healthcare service providers integrated the IoT applications and medical services to offer individuals, a seamless technology-supported healthcare service. The proposed SHC2 was implemented to demonstrate its security levels in terms of time and access policies. The model was tested under different parameters such as encryption time, decryption time, access time and response time in minimum range. Then, the level of the model and throughput were analyzed by maximum value i.e., 50 Mbps/sec and 95.56% for PRESENT-Authorization cipher to achieve smart city security. The proposed model achieved better results than the existing methodologies. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

The IoT fitness devices collect trainee data that is being used for various decision-making. However, it will face numerous security and privacy issues towards its realization. This work focuses on IoT security, especially DoS/DDoS attacks. In this paper, we have proposed a novel blockchain-enabled protocol (BEP) that uses the notion of a self-exposing node (SEN) approach for securing fitness IoT applications. The blockchain and SDN architectures are employed to enhance IoT security by a highly preventive security monitoring, analysis and response system. The proposed approach helps in detecting the DoS/DDoS attacks on the IoT fitness system and then mitigating the attacks. The BEP is used for handling Blockchain-related activities and SEN could be a sensor or actuator node within the fitness IoT system. SEN provides information about the inbound and outbound traffic to the BEP which is used to analyze the DoS/DDoS attacks on the fitness IoT system. The SEN calculates the inbound and outbound traffic features’ entropies and transmits them to the Blockchain in the form of transaction blocks. The BEP picks the whole mined blocks’ transactions and transfers them to the SDN controller node. The controller node correlates the entropies data of SENs and decides about the DoS or DDoS attack. So, there are two decision points, one is SEN, and another is the controller. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, several experiments are performed and results concerning the entropy values and attack detection rate are obtained. The proposed approach has outperformed the other two approaches concerning the attack detection rate by an increase of 11% and 18% against Approach 1 and Approach 2 respectively. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Accessing the big data generated by these applications in Cloud Servers (CSs), requires higher levels of authenticity and confidentiality during communication conducted through the Internet. Signcryption is one of the most promising approaches nowadays for overcoming such obstacles, due to its combined nature, i.e., signature and encryption. A number of researchers have developed schemes to address issues related to access control in the IoT literature, however, the majority of these schemes are based on homogeneous nature. This will be neither adequate nor practical for heterogeneous IoT environments. In addition, these schemes are based on bilinear pairing and elliptic curve cryptography, which further requires additional processing time and more communication overheads that is inappropriate for real-time communication. Consequently, this paper aims to solve the above-discussed issues, we proposed an access control scheme for IoT environments using heterogeneous signcryption scheme with the efficiency and security hardiness of hyperelliptic curve. Besides the security services such as replay attack prevention, confidentiality, integrity, unforgeability, non-repudiations, and forward secrecy, the proposed scheme has very low computational and communication costs, when it is compared to existing schemes. This is primarily because of hyperelliptic curve lighter nature of key and other parameters. The AVISPA tool is used to simulate the security requirements of our proposed scheme and the results were under two backbends (Constraint Logic-based Attack Searcher (CL-b-AtSER) and On-the-Fly Model Checker (ON-t-FL-MCR)) proved to be SAFE when the presented scheme is coded in HLPSL language.

At the same time, aerial scene classification is one of the major research areas in UAV-enabled MEC systems. In UAV aerial imagery, efficient image representation is crucial for the purpose of scene classification. The existing scene classification techniques generate mid-level image features with limited representation capabilities that often end up in producing average results. Therefore, the current research work introduces a new DL-enabled aerial scene classification model for UAV-enabled MEC systems. The presented model enables the UAVs to capture aerial images which are then transmitted to MEC for further processing. Next, Capsule Network (CapsNet)-based feature extraction technique is applied to derive a set of useful feature vectors from the aerial image. It is important to have an appropriate hyperparameter tuning strategy, since manual parameter tuning of DL model tend to produce several configuration errors. In order to achieve this and to determine the hyperparameters of CapsNet model, Shuffled Shepherd Optimization (SSO) algorithm is implemented. Finally, Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) classification model is applied to determine the appropriate class labels of aerial images. The performance of SSO-CapsNet model was validated against two openly-accessible datasets namely, UC Merced (UCM) Land Use dataset and WHU-RS dataset.

The large-scale deployment of IoT requires more effective use of network infrastructure to ensure QoS when processing big data. Generally, cloud-centric IoT application deployment involves different modules running on terminal devices and cloud servers. Fog devices with different computing capabilities must process the data generated by the end device, so deploying latency-sensitive applications in a heterogeneous fog computing environment is a difficult task. In addition, when there is an inconsistent connection delay between the fog and the terminal device, the deployment of such applications becomes more complicated. In this article, we propose an algorithm that can effectively place application modules on network nodes while considering connection delay, processing power, and sensing data volume. Compared with traditional cloud computing deployment, we conducted simulations in iFogSim to confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of end-to-end delay and network consumption. Therein, latency and execution time is insensitive to the number of sensors. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

With the rapid innovation in the intelligent sensors technology, and its integration into smart vehicles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), a novel sensing paradigm has been promoted, namely vehicular crowdsensing, which leverages on-board sensors to capture information from the surrounding environment. Collected data are then analyzed to take proper countermeasures. In this paper, we present a smart coordination mechanism between UAVs and ground vehicles (GVs), which sense information like body temperature and breathing rate of people, in order to support a variety of monitoring applications, including discovering the presence of infectious diseases. In our framework, namely GUAVA, aerial and ground vehicles are equipped with GPS devices and thermal cameras to monitor specific geographic areas, detect humans’ vital parameters and, at the same time, discover duplicate data by identifying matching faces in thermal video sequences with the GaussianFace algorithm. The sensing tasks in hard-to-reach places are assigned to UAVs, with the ability to power up wirelessly from the nearest GV and offload the collected monitoring images to it.

However, most of the existing certificateless signature schemes are not all secure to resist various attacks, such as public key replacement attacks or malicious-but-passive key-generation-center attacks.

A promising solution to this problem consists in using one dimensional signaling (i.e., real-valued modulations) jointly with widely linear (WL) processing at the receiver, which has the capability to process up to 2N−1 data-like interference from N antenna receivers, and to fulfill, for N=1, single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) of a one-dimensional interference in particular. However, when the signal of interest (SOI) and observations are jointly non-Gaussian, which is the case for most of digital radiocommunications systems, WL receivers become sub-optimal and optimal receivers become non-linear. It is then of interest to propose new non-linear receivers to improve performance of WL receivers. In this context, the paper aims at introducing, for small-scale systems, third-order complex Volterra (CV) minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers, for the reception of a digital linearly modulated SOI whose waveform is known, corrupted by potentially non-Gaussian and non-circular interference, omnipresent in practical situations. Properties, performance and adaptive implementation of these receivers in the presence of non-Gaussian and potentially non-circular interference up to the 6th-order are analyzed in this paper. In particular, some of these receivers are shown to enhance WL receiver performance for SAIC of one rectilinear interference such as binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) interference. Whereas some other receivers allow us to fulfill SAIC of 4th-order non-circular interference such as quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) interference, which is not possible using WL receivers. These new receivers open new perspectives for cancellation of non-Gaussian and potentially non-circular interference up to 6th-order in radiocommunication networks. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","MMSE; Non-circular; Non-Gaussian; Non-linear; SAIC; Widely linear, third-order Volterra","5G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Binary phase shift keying; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Internet of things; Phase shift; Quadrature phase shift keying; Signal receivers; Linear receiver; Minimum mean square error receiver; Non linear; Non-circular; Non-Gaussian; Single antenna interference cancellations; Third order; Volterra; Widely Linear; Widely linear, third-order volterrum; Mean square error",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116330376

This state facilitates the reduction in energy consumption of the NB-IoT device, especially in case of small data transmission. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of power saving factor and average delay experienced by the device for varying eDRX timer, PSM timer, DRX cycle duration, and DRX active duration values.

However, the usage of IoT in the healthcare domain will become a nightmare if patient information is not securely maintained while transferring over an insecure network or storing at the administrator end. In this manuscript, the authors have developed a secure IoT healthcare monitoring system using the Blockchain-based XOR Elliptic Curve Cryptography (BC-XORECC) technique to avoid various vulnerable attacks. Initially, the work has established an authentication process for patient details by generating tokens, keys, and tags using Length Ceaser Cipher-based Pearson Hashing Algorithm (LCC-PHA), Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and Fishers Yates Shuffled Based Adelson-Velskii and Landis (FYS-AVL) tree. The authentications prevent unauthorized users from accessing or misuse the data. After that, a secure data transfer is performed using BC-XORECC, which acts faster by maintaining high data privacy and blocking the path for the attackers. Finally, the Linear Spline Kernel-Based Recurrent Neural Network (LSK-RNN) classification monitors the patient's health status. The whole developed framework brings out a secure data transfer without data loss or data breaches and remains efficient for health care monitoring via IoT. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed framework achieves a faster encryption and decryption time, classifies the patient's health status with an accuracy of 89%, and remains robust compared with the existing state-of-the-art method. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

The paper presents a novel data-driven self-learning (DDSL) controller algorithm which is dedicated to controlling small mobile maintenance-free embedded IoT devices. The DDSL algorithm is based on a modified Q-learning algorithm which allows energy efficient data-driven behavior of mobile embedded IoT devices. The aim of the DDSL algorithm is to dynamically set operation duty cycles according to the estimation of future collected data values, leading to effective operation of power-aware systems. The presented novel solution was tested on a historical data set and compared with a fixed duty cycle reference algorithm. The root mean square error (RMSE) and measurements parameters considered for the DDSL algorithm were compared to a reference algorithm and two independent criteria (the performance score parameter and normalized geometric distance) were used for overall evaluation and comparison. The experiments showed that the novel DDSL method reaches significantly lower RMSE while the number of transmitted data count is less than or equal to the fixed duty cycle algorithm. The overall criteria performance score is 40% higher than the reference algorithm base on static confirmation settings. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Users tend to use strong textual passwords, but remembering complex passwords is hard as they often write it on a piece of paper or save it in their mobile phones. Textual passwords are slightly unprotected and are easily attackable. The attacks include dictionary, shoulder surfing, and brute force. Graphical passwords overcome the shortcomings of textual passwords and are designed to aid memorability and ease of use. This paper proposes a Process-based Pattern Authentication (PPA) system for Internet of Things (IoT) devices that does not require a server to maintain a static password of the login user. The server stores user's information, which they provide at the time of registration, i.e., the R-code and the symbol, but the P-code, i.e., the actual password, will change with every login attempt of users. In this scheme, users may draw a pattern on the basis of calculation from the P-code and R-code in the PPA pattern, and can authenticate themselves using their touch dynamic behaviors through Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ANN is trained on touch behaviors of legitimate users reporting superior performance over the existing methods. For experimental purposes, PPA is implemented as a prototype on a computer system to carry out experiments for the evaluation in terms of memorability and usability. The experiments show that the system has an effect of 5.03% of the False Rejection Rate (FRR) and 4.36% of the False Acceptance Rate (FAR), respectively. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

In order to overcome these security challenges, the fog system has delivered a powerful environment that provides additional resources for a more improved data security. However, because of the emerging of various breaches, several attacks are ceaselessly emerging in IoT and Fog environment. Consequently, the new emerging applications in IoT-Fog environment still require novel, distributed, and intelligent security models, controls, and decisions. In addition, the ever-evolving hacking techniques and methods and the expanded risks surfaces have demonstrated the importance of attacks detection systems.

Particularly, some of the nodes in IoT are mobile and dynamic in nature. Hence maintaining the link among the nodes, efficient bandwidth of the links among the mobile nodes with increased life time is a big challenge in IoT as it integrates mobile nodes with static nodes for data processing. In such networks, many routing-problems arise due to difficulties in energy and bandwidth based quality of service. Due to the mobility and finite nature of the nodes, transmission links between intermediary nodes may fail frequently, thus affecting the routing-performance of the network and the accessibility of the nodes. The existing protocols do not focus on the transmission links and energy, bandwidth and link stability of the nodes, but node links are significant factors for enhancing the quality of the routing. Link stability helps us to define whether the node is within or out of a coverage range. This paper proposed an Optimal Energy and bandwidth based Link Stability Routing (OEBLS) algorithm, to improve the link stable route with minimized error rate and throughput. In this paper, the optimal route from the source to the sink is determined based on the energy and bandwidth, link stability value. Among the existing routes, the sink node will choose the optimal route which is having less link stability value. Highly stable link is determined by evaluating link stability value using distance and velocity. Residual-energy of the node is estimated using the current energy and the consumed energy. Consumed energy is estimated using transmitted power and the received power. Available bandwidth in the link is estimated using the idle time and channel capacity with the consideration of probability of collision. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

However, this problem can be tackled with the effective design of WSN-IoT by clustering and sleep scheduling mechanisms. This paper addresses this issue by presenting novel ideas involved in the WSN operations such as grid construction, cluster head selection, sleep scheduling, and data gathering by intelligent Agents (iAgents). An energy-efficient dual iAgents based Heterogeneous WSN (E2IA-HWSN) is proposed. iAgents are used in this paper to automatically collect the sensed data from IoT sensors. In this E2IA-HWSN, a 3 × 3 grid is built and each cell is sub-divided into four in which cluster heads (CH) are selected in each sub-division, followed by ring partitioning for selecting a CH present at the center. Multi-Objective Harris Hawks optimization (MO-HHO) algorithm is used to select CH and supernode, here to minimize the energy consumption of CH, the supernode takes responsibility to assign sleep schedules to devices. The scheduling slots are assigned only after a sensor reaches below the energy threshold. For scheduling, the Bayes rule-based Markov model (BR-MM) is applied with the determination of residual energy and sensed packet counts. Generator de Bits Pseudo Aleatorios (GBPA) eliminates redundant data in CH and then inter-cluster routing is performed in case of emergency events. If not, then the CH waits for the arrival of iagents, the trajectory of iAgents is dynamically predicted with Deep Policy Gradient (DDPG). The implementation is carried out in NS3.26 and the results show betterment to the well-known methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Data gathering; Data redundancy; Emergency event; Grid; Sleep scheduling; WSN-IoT","Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Intelligent agents; Markov processes; Scheduling; Sleep research; Agent based; Cluster-heads; Data gathering; Data-redundancy; Emergency events; Energy efficient; Grid; Sleep scheduling; Supernode; WSN-IoT; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116023581

However, the functionality of such cyber–physical systems, which is usually distributed in several devices and computers, imposes specific requirements on the infrastructure to run properly. The evolution of an application to meet new user requirements and the high diversity of hardware and software technologies in the IoT/Edge/Cloud can complicate the deployment of continuously evolving applications. The aim of our approach is to apply Multi Layer Feature Models, which capture the variability of applications and the software and hardware infrastructure, to support the deployment in edge-based environments of cyber–physical applications. With this multi-layered approach is possible to support the evolution of application and infrastructure independently. Considering that IoT/Edge/Cloud infrastructures are usually shared by many applications, the deployment process has to assure that there will be enough resources for all of them, informing developers about the feasible alternatives. We provide four modules so that the developer can calculate what is the configuration of minimal set of devices supporting application requirements of the evolved application. In addition, the developer can find what is the application configuration that can be hosted in the current infrastructure. The successive solutions of continuous deployment generated by our approach pursue the reduction of the system energy footprint and/or execution latency. © 2021 The Author(s)","DevOps; Edge Computing; SMT Optimization; Software Product Lines; Task allocation problem; Task Deployment; Variability models","Application programs; Computer hardware; Internet of things; Allocation problems; Edge computing; Edge-based; Optimisations; SMT optimization; Software Product Line; Task allocation; Task allocation problem; Task deployment; Variability modeling; Edge computing",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115968962

Survival analysis shows its strength in modeling such signals to determine the condition of in-service equipment and products to yield critical operational decisions, i.e., maintenance and repair. One appealing aspect of survival analysis is the possibility to include subjects in the model which did not have their failure yet or when the exact failure time is unknown. NN-based survival models, i.e., deep survival models, show superior performance in modeling the non-linear relationship between the reliability function and covariates. We propose a novel deep survival model, seq2surv, to incorporate the seq2seq structure and attention mechanism to enhance the ability to analyze a sequence of signals in the survival analysis. Similar to the seq2seq model which shows superior performance in machine translation, we designed the seq2surv model to translate from a sequence of signals to a sequence of survival probabilities and to update the reliability predictions along with real-time monitoring. Our results show that the seq2surv model outperforms existing deep survival approaches in terms of higher prediction accuracy and lower errors in the survival function estimation on both simulated and real-world datasets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Internet of things; Prognostics; Sequence modeling; Survival analysis","Bioinformatics; Deep learning; Manufacture; Real time systems; Repair; Time series analysis; Deep learning; Operating condition; Performance; Sequence models; Signal tracking; Smart manufacturing; Smart products; Survival analysis; Survival model; Time-series data; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115890975

Internet of things (IoT)-based diagnostic devices would be an ideal platform for point-of-care (POC) screening of COVID-19 and ubiquitous healthcare monitoring for patients. Herein, we present an advanced IoT-based POC device for real-time direct reverse-transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification assay to detect SARS-CoV-2. The diagnostic system is miniaturized (10 cm [height] × 9 cm [width] × 5.5 cm [length]) and lightweight (320 g), which can be operated with a portable battery and a smartphone. Once a liquid sample was loaded into an integrated microfluidic chip, a series of sample lysis, nucleic amplification, and real-time monitoring of the fluorescent signals of amplicons were automatically performed. Four reaction chambers were patterned on the chip, targeting As1e, N, E genes and a negative control, so multiple genes of SARS-CoV-2 could be simultaneously analyzed. The fluorescence intensities in each chamber were measured by a CMOS camera upon excitation with a 488 nm LED light source. The recorded data were processed by a microprocessor inside the IoT-based POC device and transferred and displayed on the wirelessly connected smartphone in real-time. The positive results could be obtained using three primer sets of SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 2 × 101 genome copies/μL, and the clinical sample of SARS-CoV-2 was successfully analyzed with high sensitivity and accuracy.

In CON, traditional type pumps were replaced from pole stands to pole stands. In MULTI, the smart pumps were replaced from multi-layer rack to multi-layer rack, and in ONE the smart pumps were replaced from pole stands to multi-layer rack. In each group, the subject round-transported the simulated patient and re-replaced the pumps. The time of both pump replacements and the transport time were significantly shorter in MULTI and ONE compared with CON (p < 0.0001). The perceived burden of the replacement and transport were all significantly lower in MULTI and ONE than CON (p < 0.0001).

In this mechanism, D2D collaborative coalitions are automatically formed among IoVT devices and video content is shared in the coalitions through D2D links.

In this paper, a novel distributed functional link least mean square (DFLMS) algorithm based on rblackthe diffusion strategy is proposed, in which the diffusion functional link network (DFLN) is used to model the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the distributed system. In particular, by using different orthogonal polynomials, we develop four types of DFLNs, i.e., trigonometric DFLN (TDFLN), Legendre DFLN (LDFLN), Chebyshev DFLN (CDFLN), and Hermite DFLN (HDFLN). However, the censored measurement caused by the range of sensors brings great challenges to the traditional distributed nonlinear estimation. To tackle this problem, a censored regression-distributed functional link adaptive filtering (CR-DFLAF) algorithm is further proposed.

Energy-saving applications in such environments can benefit from the use of sensors and actuators when data are properly fused with previous knowledge about user habits and feedback about current user preferences. In this article, we present an online recommender system implemented in the EM3 platform, a platform for Consumer Engagement Toward Energy-Saving Behavior. The recommender system uniquely fuses sensors’ data with user habits and user feedback and provides personalized recommendations for energy efficiency at the right moment. The user response to the recommendations directly triggers actuators that perform energy-saving actions and is recorded and processed for refining future recommendations. The EM3 recommendation engine continuously evaluates the three inputs (i.e. sensor data, user habits, user feedback) and identifies the micro-moments that maximize the need for the recommended action and thus the recommendation acceptance. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed recommender system, which is based on a stacked-LSTM for fusing multi-sensor data streams, in several scenarios, and the observed accuracy on predicting the right moment to send a recommendation to the user ranged from 93% to 97%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Data fusion; Energy efficiency; Fusion-based recommendations; Internet of things; Recommender systems","Actuators; Automation; Consumer behavior; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Feedback; Recommender systems; Sensor data fusion; Energy savings; Energy-consumption; Energy-savings; Fusion-based recommendation; Save energy; Sensors data; Smart homes; Smart offices; User feedback; User habit; Internet of things; energy efficiency; energy use; knowledge; sensor",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115003906

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between 2000 and 2019, using search terms covering digital technology and food environment, which yielded 13,580 unique records. Our analysis of 357 studies shows that digitalization is taking place in all dimensions of the food environment, and enabling the emergence of new forms of buying and selling food, such as online grocery shopping and online food delivery, which may be changing availability of foods and affecting the physical distance to shops and time allocated for shopping. Systematic reviews identified indicated that digital food marketing and social media can influence food choices, preferences and consumption.

This paper presents a novel technique for plant health monitoring by estimating sulphur dioxide. Here, the simulation of IoT was performed for improved functioning. After that, the cluster head selection and routing are performed using the proposed invasive water cycle (IWC) algorithm, which is devised by integrating the water cycle algorithm (WCA) and invasive weed optimization (IWO) algorithm. Here, the fitness function is newly modeled using certain factors involving Energy, intra and intercluster distance, and delay. After the cluster head selection and routing, the sulphur dioxide content from the soil is estimated. For sulphur dioxide estimation, the soil data is considered the input data, and then the data transformation is performed to transform the data. After that, the feature selection is performed by Mahalanobis distance, and then sulphur dioxide from the soil is estimated using Deep Q-Network, where training is performed using the proposed IWC algorithm.

In this paper, UrNext, a location-aware mobile-based solution using Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) technology is presented to solve the problem. Recently, a technology-oriented method, the Internet of Things (IoT), has been gaining popularity in helping to solve some of the healthcare sector's problems. The implementation of this solution could be illustrated through a simple example of when a patient arrives at a clinic for a consultation. Instead of having to wait in long lines, that patient will be greeted automatically, receive a push notification of an admittance along with an estimated waiting time for a consultation session. This will not only provide the patients with a sense of freedom but would also reduce the uncertainty levels that are generally observed, thus saving both time and money. This work aims to improve the clinics' quality of services, organize queues and minimize waiting times, leading to patients' comfort while reducing the burden on nurses and receptionists.

Unfortunately, the spoofing attack, a kind of cyber-risk, has increased the number of cyber-criminals in data transfer applications without being detected, especially in smart cities. Several applications based on online video communications, such as online testing and video conferences, are involved in smart cities. The video displays various variations of a person, which makes face recognition an important concept in security implementation. The face spoofing attacks are mainly based on the person's face replication by replaying a video or by printed photos. Therefore, video forgery detection and related spoof attack detection have become a new topic in cybersecurity research. From this perspective, this paper presents a deep learning approach for video face forensic detection with a cyber facial spoofing attack using two methodologies. The first methodology is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the input video frames. The model has five convolutional layers followed by five pooling layers. The second methodology is based on convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM). This model comprises two pooling layers, two convolutional layers, and a convolutional LSTM layer. Each methodology includes a fully-connected layer to interconnect between the feature map resulting from the feature extraction process and the classification layer. A SoftMax layer performs the classification task in each method. This paper aims to achieve an optimum modality for face forensic detection to overcome spoofing attacks. Simulation results reveal that the ConvLSTM with CNN methodology achieves better classification results as the extracted features are more comprehensive than those of other conventional approaches. Also, it achieves an accuracy of 99%, and the works presented in the literature achieve an accuracy levels up to 95%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Cloud; CNN; ConvLSTM; Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Forensics detection; Forgery detection; IoT; Spoof attacks","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data transfer; Deep learning; Face recognition; Facsimile; Image coding; Image communication systems; Internet of things; Long short-term memory; Security of data; Smart city; Web services; Classification results; Classification tasks; Conventional approach; Forensic detection; Internet of Things (IOT); Recent researches; Security implementations; Video transmissions; Digital forensics",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114382217

In this model, a RIS is deployed to increase the system secrecy and communication performances to deal with eavesdropping attacks. To measure the security performances, we firstly expose analytical results for the secrecy outage probability. We provide insights with asymptotic analysis to identify system parameters that significantly affect the secrecy performance of our proposed RIS-aided IoT systems. In particular, the findings show that by controlling the number of metasurface elements of the RIS and the average signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), system performances can be improved. We verify such a RIS-aided IoT system within many practical situations by conducting Monte-Carlo simulations in the Matlab simulation platform. We compared our analytical results with the Monte-Carlo simulations to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed closed-form expressions of secure performance metrics.

Nevertheless, upon deploying adaptive antenna arrays in complex IoT platforms, the radiation patterns that result from the use of such adaptive algorithms may be adjusted to the preceding location of the node and not attuned to the current location.

As DOA is time varying in an IoT Drone environment, existing algorithms for estimating the DOA like MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) and Estimation of Signal Parameter via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT) cannot be used to track the signal subspace recursively, as they are based on batch eigenvalue decomposition which is highly time consuming with a time complexity of O(n3). Furthermore, DOA estimation algorithms do not result in robust subspace estimates when the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is low.The main novelty of the proposed work is a low computational complexity subspace tracking algorithm for tracking DOA in order to provide seamless connectivity. Simulation results show that the proposed DOA tracking takes lesser time for tracking the current location of the drone target as opposed to conventional DOA estimation methods. Furthermore,it is observed that the tracking process remains unaffected by SNR. © 2021","Adaptive antenna arrays; DOA tracking; Drone; IoT; Seamless communication","Adaptive algorithms; Adaptive systems; Aircraft detection; Beam forming networks; Computational complexity; Computer music; Directional patterns (antenna); Drones; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Internet of things; Location; Signal analysis; Signal to noise ratio; Smart antennas; Target drones; DOA estimation algorithms; DOA estimation method; Eigenvalue decomposition; Internet of Things (IOT); Low computational complexity; Multiple signal classification; Rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT); Subspace tracking algorithms; Direction of arrival",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114037711

Secure communication and secure resource sharing among intelligent terminals are essential. A secure communication channel for intelligent terminals can be established through group key agreement (GKA), thereby ensuring the security communication and resource sharing for intelligent terminals. Taking into account the confidentiality level of the shared resources of each terminal, and the different permissions of the resource sharing of each terminal, a GKA protocol for intelligent IoTs is proposed. Compared with previous work, this protocol mainly has the following advantages: (1) The hidden attribute identity authentication technology can achieve the security of identity authentication and protect personal privacy from being leaked; (2) Only intelligent terminals satisfying the threshold required of the GKA can participate in the GKA, which increases the security of group communication; (3) Low-level group terminals can obtain new permissions to participate in high-level group communication if they meet certain conditions. High-level group terminals can participate in low-level group communication through permission authentication, which increases the flexibility and security of group communication; (4) The intelligent terminals in the group can use their own attribute permission parameters to calculate the group key. They can verify the correctness of the calculated group key through a functional relationship, and does not need to exchange information with other members in the same group.

In IoT based smart cities, the smart objects (devices) are connected with each other via internet as a backbone. The sensed data by the smart objects are transmitted to the sink for further processing using multi hop communication. The smart cities use the analyzed data to improve their infrastructure, public utilities and they enhance their services by using the IoT technology for the betterment of livelihood of the common people. For IoT based smart cities, waste collection is a prominent issue for municipalities that aim to achieve a clean environment. With a boom in population in urban areas, an increasing amount of waste is generated. A major issue of waste management system is the poor process used in waste collection and segregation. Public bins begin to overflow for a long period before the process of cleaning starts, which is resulting in an accumulation of bacteria causing bad odors and spreading of diseases. In order to overcome this issue, in this paper an IoT based smart predication and monitoring of waste disposal system is proposed which utilizes off-the-shelf components that can be mounted to a bin of any size and measure fill levels. An Arduino microcontroller is employed in the proposed model to interface the infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), weight sensors, and a Global Positioning System (GPS) module is used to monitor the status of bins at predetermined intervals. The proposed system transmits the data using the cluster network to the master module which is connected to the backend via Wi-Fi. As data is collected, an intelligent neural network algorithm namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is used which will intelligently learn and predict the upcoming wastage from waste generation patterns. Moreover, the proposed system uses Firebase Cloud Messaging to notify the appropriate people when the bins were full and needed to be emptied. The Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) JavaScript Application Programming Interface (API) is used to send notification messages in web apps in browsers that provide service work support. Hence, the proposed system is useful to the society by providing facilities to the governments for enforcing stricter regulations for waste disposal.

To achieve the desired results, we need to optimally allocate network resources to existing users. Resource allocation has traditionally been considered an optimization problem where proposed solutions are hard to implement in real time, resulting in the use of inferior solutions with reduced produced performance. With the introduction of Machine Learning, we propose three mechanisms, intending to utilize network data to improve real time network performance. The first mechanism, a Decision Trees based mechanism aims to improve real time decision making by predicting the optimal matching of users and Base Stations. The second mechanism, a K-means based mechanism intends to tackle network congestion and ensure uninterrupted Quality of Service by predicting the optimal coordinates for placing Base Stations along the network based on traffic data. Finally, a Regression based mechanism manages to predict user movement along the network, resulting in improved resource management and reduced energy waste.

To mitigate this issue, email classification is an important solution with the aim of distinguishing legitimate and spam emails. Artificial intelligence especially machine learning is a major tool for helping detect malicious emails, but the performance might be fluctuant according to specific datasets.

In a conventional design, the sleep power accounts for most of the total power consumption, and cannot be reduced further due to the low power efficiency of dc-dc converters at the load current 100 nA. Voltage stacking has been proposed to address power efficiency. However, prior voltage-stacking architectures could not realize dynamic switching between flat mode and stack mode, leading to high dynamic power consumption in the normal state. This article proposes a dynamic voltage-stacking scheme, which supports two operating modes: a flat mode in the normal state and a stack mode in the sleep state. In the flat mode, the retention memories, RTC and XO32, are connected in parallel and are powered by the switched-capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR). In the stack mode, the four instances are connected in series, including the static random access memory (SRAM1) (level1), the SRAM2 (level2), and the XO32 and the RTC (level3), and the on-chip SCVR is shut down for power saving. The measurements show that compared with the conventional flat architecture, the dynamic voltage-stacking scheme reduces the sleep current by 38% under the same circumstances, and it also improves ULPMark-CP score by 23.6%, which is higher than the top1 in the ULPMark score list. © 1966-2012 IEEE.","Microcontrollers; power management; voltage stacking","DC-DC converters; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Memory architecture; Microcontrollers; Sleep research; Static random access storage; Voltage regulators; Conventional design; Internet of Things (IOT); Microcontroller unit; Stacking architecture; Static random access memory; Switched capacitor; Total power consumption; Ultra-low power consumption; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112656762

In view of the recent advances in IoT devices and the emerging new breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), the fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN (C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs) coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing policy.

Along with the massive deployment of low-cost insecure Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, the fast proliferation of IoT botnets dramatically increases the risk of LFAs. However, how to efficiently defend against LFAs in IoT still remains as an open problem. To overcome this challenge, we model the interaction between an LFA attacker and the network manager as a two-person Bayesian game in this article to precisely characterize the behaviors of both sides. Then, the rational behaviors of the attacker and the optimal strategies of the defender are unveiled by deriving the Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE). Inspired by the obtained BNEs, a cost-effective decision framework is proposed for the defender to make defense decisions. Furthermore, we numerically analyze the effect of all the related factors and present feasible suggestions to deter attack motivations fundamentally. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of the defender's utilities under different attack intensities, but also is robust to the changes in important parameters, including the value of benign traffic and the latency of traffic scrubbing. © 2014 IEEE.","Bayesian game; defense decision-making; Internet of Things (IoT); link flooding attack (LFA)","Cost effectiveness; Denial-of-service attack; Floods; Game theory; Network security; Bayesian Nash equilibria; Cost effective decision; Different attacks; Distributed denial of service attack; Internet of Things (IOT); Massive deployment; Optimal strategies; Rational behavior; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112240253

In any case, the performance of IoT networks may be limited due to several impairments, most importantly, the energy-constrained IoT nodes. In fact, this limitation opens the door to many researchers where using network clustering has proven to be efficient energy saving mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, there are no prior research, in the field of multi-hop clustered IoT networks, which addressed the energy-constrained IoT nodes problem along with the delay in receiving data messages from devices, located far away from the remote users (or control center), in timely basis. Practically, it is significantly challenging to contemplate and clarify this issue. Consequently, in this paper, we make major amendments on the prior work, Improved Energy and Distance Based CH Selection with Balanced Objective Function (IEDB-CHS-BOF), and particularly propose a multi-hop routing (MR) protocol in which the IoT network is divided into a number of virtual sections with lengths held below the cross-over communication distance, thereby ensuring minimal energy depletion. Over those virtual sections, efficient forwarder and cluster head selection algorithms are further proposed. Interestingly, we propose a novel delay-, power-, and interference-aware time slot allocation model in which Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) MAC protocols are operated. Furthermore, it is a good representation of the above-mentioned proposals. As a result, our protocols are referred to as MR-IEDB-CHS-TDMA and MR-IEDB-CHS-DSSS, respectively. To this end, numerous simulations have been conducted for evaluating the performance of the proposed protocols in the perspective of IoT network lifetime. In addition, sufficient comparisons have been conducted with the existing state-of-the-art protocols. In overall, the MR-IEDB-CHS-TDMA protocol keeps the IoT network functioning the longest. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Delay; Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS); Energy-constrained IoT nodes; Interference; Internet of Things (IoT); Time slot allocation model","Air traffic control; Energy conservation; Internet protocols; Medium access control; Multiple access interference; Time division multiple access; Cluster-head selections; Communication distance; Direct sequence spread spectrum; Energy saving mechanism; Internet of Things (IOT); State-of-the art protocols; Time division multiple accesses (TDMA); Time slot allocation; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111544122

Although the CS-based perfectly secure scheme has no such vulnerabilities, its practical realization is challenging. In this article, we propose an energy concealment (EC) encryption scheme, a practical realization of the perfectly secure scheme by concealing energy, thereby removing the requirement of an additional secure channel. We propose three different methods to generate sensing matrix to improve energy efficiency using linear feedback shift registers and lagged Fibonacci sequences. Leveraging the signal's maximum energy in the EC scheme, we design a new measure to evaluate reconstructed signal quality without the knowledge of the original signal. Furthermore, a new CS decoding algorithm is designed by incorporating the knowledge of maximum energy at the decoder, which improves the signal reconstruction quality while reducing the number of measurements. Additionally, our comprehensive security analysis shows that the EC scheme is secure against various cryptographic attacks.

An essential feature of our model is that it includes the interferences caused by the secondary users to the primary users, and we show that these interferences significantly impact the system performance of massive IoT networks.

At the same time, big data and real-time data analysis have taken on great importance and have been accompanied by unprecedented interest in sharing data among citizens, public administrations and other organisms, giving rise to what is known as the Collaborative Internet of Things. This growth in data and infrastructure must be accompanied by a software architecture that allows its exploitation. Although there are various proposals focused on the exploitation of the IoT at edge, fog and/or cloud levels, it is not easy to find a software solution that exploits the three tiers together, taking maximum advantage not only of the analysis of contextual and situational data at each tier, but also of two-way communications between adjacent ones. In this paper, we propose an architecture that solves these deficiencies by proposing novel technologies which are appropriate for managing the resources of each tier: edge, fog and cloud. In addition, the fact that two-way communications along the three tiers of the architecture is allowed considerably enriches the contextual and situational information in each layer, and substantially assists decision making in real time. The paper illustrates the proposed software architecture through a case study of respiratory disease surveillance in hospitals.

Among those, a big challenge is how to keep all of the devices accessible everywhere and every time. In the IoT network, the assumption is that each IoT device can be reached by any client at any given time. In practice, this is not always possible and without a proper mechanism the nodes behind a NAT are unable to communicate with each other directly, and their addresses have to be shared through a trusted third party. This challenge becomes harder by taking into consideration that most NAT traversal approaches have been developed prior to rising of the IoT, without taking into account the constrained nature of the participating devices and mostly depend on a centralized entity. In this paper we proposed the Distributed Address Table (DAT), a decentralized, secure and lightweight address distribution model that allows any two nodes to get the addresses of the other end without relying on a trusted third party. Structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay by utilizing Distributed Hash Table (DHT) technique is generated as its underlying communication scheme to ensure that all participating devices are accessible at any given time. This is achieved through simple, yet secure and efficient decentralized model. The DAT adopts the edge/fog computing paradigms to ensure a decentralized address distribution. The results showed that the proposed model is efficient.

Managing congestion control in a resource-constrained lossy network with a high bit error rate is a significantly challenging task that needs to be addressed. The primary congestion control mechanism defined by CoAP specification leverages on basic binary exponential backoff and often fails to utilize the network dynamics to the best of its traffic conditions. As a result, CoCoA has been introduced for better IoT resource utilization. In addition, CoCoA retransmission timeout (RTO) for network dynamics is based on constant coefficient values. The resource-constrained nature of IoT networks poses new design challenges for congestion control mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a new particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based congestion control approach called psoCoCoA as a variation of CoCoA. The psoCoCoA applies random and optimal parameter-driven simulation to optimize default CoAP parameters and update the fitness and velocity positions to adapt to the traffic conditions. This process is performed for different traffic scenarios by varying the retransmission and max-age values by using the optimization-based algorithm. We carried out extensive simulations to validate the congestion control performance for CoAP with Observe, CoCoA, and psoCoCoA with different network topologies.

With the proliferation of physical things being connected to internet and enabled with sensory capabilities to form an Internet of Thing (IoT) network, it is increasingly important to run CNN inference, a computationally intensive application, on the resource constrained IoT devices. Object detection is a fundamental computer vision problem that provides information for image understanding in several artificial intelligence (AI) applications in smart cities. Among various object detection algorithms, CNN has emerged as a new paradigm to improve the overall performance. The Multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, which are used repeatedly in the convolution layers of CNN, hold extreme computational complexity. Hence, the overall computational workloads and their respective energy consumption of any CNN applications are on the rise. To overcome these escalating challenges, approximate computing mechanism has played a vital role in reducing power and area of computation intensive CNN applications. In this paper, we have designed an approximate MAC architecture, termed Shift and Accumulator Unit (SAC), for the error-resilient CNN based object detection algorithm targeting embedded platforms. The proposed computing unit deliberately trades accuracy to reduce design complexity and power consumption, thus suiting the resource constrained IoT devices. The pipeline architecture of the SAC unit saves approximately 1.8× clock cycles than the non-pipeline SAC architecture.

As a result, connections between personal identity and the ownership of on-chain location information are decoupled. Meanwhile, the owner of the on-chain location data can still claim its ownership without revealing the private key to anyone else. 2) An artificial potential field-based incentive allocation mechanism is proposed to incentivize IoT witnesses to pursue the maximum monitoring coverage deployment.

Conventional approaches use cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate and verify legitimate devices' identities. However, cryptographic protocols are not available in many systems. Meanwhile, these methods are less effective when legitimate devices can be exploited or encryption keys are disclosed. Therefore, noncryptographic IoT-device identification and rogue device detection become efficient solutions to secure existing systems and will provide additional protection to systems with cryptographic protocols.

RPL has inherent security features to restrict external attacks. However, internal attacks in the IoT environment have continued to grow due to the lack of mechanisms to manage the secure identities and credentials of the billions of heterogeneous IoT devices. Weak credentials aid attackers in gaining access to IoT devices and further exploiting vulnerabilities stemming from the underlying routing protocols. Routing attacks degrade the performance of IoT networks by compromising the network resources, topology, and traffic. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework for the prediction of routing attacks in RPL-based IoT. The framework leverages Graph Convolution Network-based network embedding to capture and learn the latent state of the nodes in the IoT network. It uses a Long Short Term Memory model to predict network traffic. The framework incorporates a Feedforward Neural Network that uses network embedding and traffic prediction as input to predict routing attacks. The accuracy of any learning model depends on the integrity of the data provided to it as input. Therefore, the framework uses smart contract-fortified blockchain technology to establish secure channels for IoT data access. The smart contract within the blockchain generates warning impulses in the case of abnormal behavior of nodes. The framework predicts normal scenarios, resource attack scenarios, traffic attack scenarios, and topological attack scenarios with a fair accuracy of 94.5%, 82.46%, 91.88%, and 86.13%, respectively. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","IoT; Network embeddings; Routing attacks; RPL; Smart contract","Blockchain; Embeddings; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Low power electronics; Network routing; Routing protocols; Topology; Abnormal behavior; Holistic frameworks; Internet of thing (IOT); Network embedding; Network resource; Security features; Short term memory; Traffic prediction; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107474290

As a solution to these problems, the Fog-of-Things (FoT) paradigm has emerged. This paradigm promises numerous benefits for latency-sensitive IoT service design, by reducing IoT data traffic toward the cloud. Since FoT utilizes heterogeneous services, the decision outputs of these services are transmitted by multipriority data packet traffic patterns. For the full utilization of fog computing benefits, we need to model this traffic and apply an efficient data traffic scheduling approach. In this study, we address the starvation challenge of multipriority FoT data traffic scheduling in a scalable fog architecture and propose a complex event processing-based efficient scheduling policy for its prevention. We first give the arrival-service model for FoT data traffic using finite-size multilevel waiting lines. Then, we compare the proposed policy with the first-in-first-out and multipriority-discipline queue policies through a comprehensive analysis of waiting times and wait-time gap characteristics.

Recently, due to the crucial importance of human well-being, IoT-enabled healthcare systems have gained significant attention. On the other hand, as IoT networks are large-scaled and battery-powered, developing proper energy and resource management mechanisms for them is inevitable. On account of the large amount of data generated in IoT environments, data aggregation is vital to lower energy consumption and extend network lifespan, and many researchers have endeavored to enhance its efficiency. However, there is no optimized method for the dynamic, complex, and nonlinear nature of healthcare applications. Fuzzy logic could be effective in these scenarios because it can convert qualitative data to quantitative, implement complex nonlinear functions, and present approximate solutions for cases where there is no single optimal answer, and it changes with a slight variation in conditions.

To this end, we present mmKey, the first universal virtual keyboard system using a single millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio.

We design a novel signal processing pipeline to detect, segment and separate, and finally, recognize keystrokes. mmKey does not need any training except for a minimal one-time effort of only three key-presses for keyboard calibration upon the initial setup. We prototype mmKey using a commodity 802.11ad/ay chipset, customized to support radar-like operations, and evaluate it with different keyboard layouts under various settings.

We present a space-time-frequency channel state information (CSI)-based key generation scheme based on a two-step approach of adaptive link selection and stepwise decorrelation algorithms. The performance is evaluated in terms of KGR, key disagreement rate (KDR), randomness, and computational complexity by using both a standardized channel model and real-world measurements. Numerical results show that our proposed low-complexity algorithms effectively utilize the space-time-frequency CSI to multiply the KGR in both indoor and outdoor environments. Through adaptive link selection in DAS, the KDR is maintained within a correctable range, thereby ensuring the validity of generated keys in dynamic environments. Further applying stepwise decorrelation reduces the computational complexity by more than half while satisfying all eight key generation randomness tests in the NIST test suite. © 2014 IEEE.","Antenna selection; decorrelation; physical-layer security; secret key generation; wireless channel","Antennas; Channel capacity; Channel state information; Computational complexity; Internet of things; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Random processes; Distributed antenna system; Dynamic environments; Internet of Things (IOT); Low complexity algorithm; Outdoor environment; Secret key generations; Space-time frequencies; Space-time-frequency channel; Cryptography",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107214283

However, the data aggregation function will compromise the privacy of device data. In this article, we proposed an efficient privacy-preserving multidimensional data aggregation scheme for IoT, called PMDA. The scheme uses the Chinese remainder theorem to design a homomorphic encryption method that encryptes a multiple-dimensional small integer vector into one ciphertext and keeps linear homomorphic properties per dimension. Combining with the signature mechanism and the batch verification method, the scheme guarantees nonrepudiation of device data and enhance verification efficiency at edge nodes. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve correctness, privacy, authentication, and integrity. After performance evaluation, we demonstrate that our scheme is superior to other schemes in terms of computation and communication costs.

A logic camouflaging circuit is proposed that uses a balanced power consumption and threshold voltage-defined technique to provide an antiphysical attack scheme to protect the hardware security for IoT devices. The proposed circuit uses a symmetric differential pull-down network in implementing the different logic functions through the threshold voltage reconfiguration circuit. As a result, the power consumption of the circuit attains balance and stability between two different logical operations. The proposed threshold voltage-defined power-balance (TVD-PB) design is fabricated using a 65-nm CMOS technology, and the core area occupies approximately 0.0044 mm2, composed of NAND, NOR, XOR, and INV components and multiplier gates of the proposed TVD-PB circuit. The entire chip passed the logic function tests. The measured results show that the average similarity of the TVD-PB universal gate is 99.68%. In addition, the current margin is higher than 55 μA and power consumption of 0.455 mW during each clock cycle at 1.2 V derives 0.1072% of the normalized energy deviation and 0.0453% of the normalized standard deviation.

Low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) have recently received significant attention to meet these requirements of IoT applications. Long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN) with long range (LoRa) (the physical layer design for LoRaWAN) has emerged as a leading LPWAN solution for IoT. However, LoRa networks suffer from the scalability issue when supporting a large number of end devices that access the shared channels randomly. The scalability of LoRa networks greatly depends on the spreading factor (SF) allocation schemes. In this article, we propose an exponential windowing scheme (EWS) for LoRa networks to improve the scalability of LoRa networks. EWS is a distance-based SF allocation scheme. It assigns a distance parameter to each SF to maximize the success probability of the overall LoRa network. Using stochastic geometry, expressions for success probability are derived under co-SF interference. The impact of exponential windowing and packet size is analyzed on packet success probability. In addition, the proposed scheme is compared with the existing distance-based SF allocation schemes: equal-interval-based and equal-area-based schemes, and it is shown that the proposed scheme performs better than the other two schemes. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Long range (LoRa) network; LoRaWAN; scalability; spreading factor (SF) assignment; stochastic geometry","Internet of things; Low power electronics; Probability; Scalability; Stochastic systems; Distance parameter; Equal intervals; Geographic areas; Internet of Things (IOT); IOT applications; Scalability issue; Spreading factor; Stochastic geometry; Wide area networks",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104599200

These devices are characterised by severe resource constraints in terms of memory, processing power, and bandwidth.

While SNMP does work with these devices, it has an unnecessary overhead resulting in a waste of resources that could otherwise be used for some other task, or to save energy.

The generalization ability of LSTM neural networks is promoted through introducing the distributed memory cells to implement the information sharing between different edge servers and employing the attention mechanism in LSTM neural networks. Meanwhile, the deep fully connected networks are deployed among the cloud to extract the spatiotemporal correlations in the variety of data from different time and space regions, which enhances the transferability of LSTM neural networks. Numerical experiment shows that the proposed DLSTM neural networks reduce 36% model parameters size, 32% memory consumption among the cloud, and more than half of the prediction errors compared with traditional LSTM neural networks. Besides, the favourable transferability of the present DLSTM neural networks is also verified via numerical experiment. © 2013 IEEE.","Deep learning; Distributed long short-term memory; Edge computing; Internet of Things","Brain; Deep learning; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Memory architecture; Attention mechanisms; Distributed Memory; Fully connected networks; Generalization ability; Information sharing; Internet of Things (IOT); Learning efficiency; Spatiotemporal correlation; Long short-term memory",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100458453

These issues need to be carefully addressed due to the sensitive data within IoT systems. However, some IoT devices have various limitations in terms of energy, memory capacity, and computational resources, which makes them extremely vulnerable to security attacks. Data integrity with source authentication are essential security services for protecting IoT data value and utility. Existing message authentication algorithms (MAAs), which are either based on block ciphers or keyed hash functions, require multiple rounds and complex operations, which leads to unacceptable overhead for resource-limited devices and delay-sensitive applications. Moreover, the high number of IoT connected devices generates a huge amount of data, which challenges even the capacity of powerful network devices to handle the security of such Big Data. As such, the protection of such amounts of generated data calls for lightweight security solutions. In this paper, we propose a lightweight MAA that provides data integrity and source authentication. The proposed solution is based on a dynamic key structure with a single round and simple operations. The used cryptographic primitives (substitution and permutation tables) are dynamic and get updated for each new input message by using specific update primitives. The dynamic structure of the proposed MAA allows for decreasing the required number of rounds to just one, while maintaining a high degree of security. The security tests results show that the proposed keyed hash functions (1) achieve the desired cryptographic properties, (2) are immune against existing attacks and (3) require low overhead in terms of computational and storage resources. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Dynamic key-dependent cryptography; Lightweight message authentication algorithm; Security and performance analysis","Authentication; Digital storage; Hash functions; Privacy by design; Public key cryptography; Computational resources; Cryptographic primitives; Cryptographic properties; Delay-sensitive applications; Internet of thing (IOT); Lightweight securities; Message authentication algorithms; Resource-limited devices; Internet of things",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099951018

In this article, we investigate the security threats to the edge devices in the IoT-assisted networks because of the inherent vulnerabilities present in the IoT devices, and formulate a novel graphical security model to conduct vulnerability-based risk assessment in such networks.

For securing the target devices, we propose a randomized algorithm to enforce isolation of potential target devices from the attackers. The algorithm produces the least number of vulnerabilities, the removal of which protects the targets. For densely connected networks, we propose another algorithm to identify a minimal set of vulnerabilities to be hardened so as to keep potential targets below admissible levels of risk.

The quantitative research method was adopted for this study and the adopted questionnaire was structured on a five-point Likert scale to elicit the opinion of respondents on the challenges of the application of the Internet of Things in the Nigerian construction industry.

The decay of stale elements can control false-positives. Existing mechanisms for decay require unreasonable storage and computation. Inexpensive methods reset the BF periodically, resulting in inconsistent guarantees and performance issues in the underlying computing system. In this article, we propose Fading Bloom filter (FadingBF), which can provide inexpensive yet safe decay of elements. FadingBF neither requires additional storage nor computation to achieve this but instead exploits the underlying storage medium's intrinsic properties, i.e., DRAM capacitor characteristics. We realize FadingBF by implementing the BF on a DRAM memory module with its periodic refresh disabled. Consequently, the capacitors holding the data elements that are not accessed frequently will predictably lose charge and naturally decay. The retention time of capacitors guarantees against premature deletion. However, some capacitors may store information longer than required due to the FadingBF's software and hardware variables. Using an analytical model of the FadingBF, we show that carefully tuning its parameters can minimize such cases. For a surveillance application, we demonstrate that FadingBF achieves better guarantees through graceful decay, consumes 57 percent lesser energy, and has a system load that is lesser than the standard BF. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","bloom filters; data compaction and compression; data storage representations; DRAM capacitors; dynamic storage management; false negatives; Internet of Things; Online information services; surveillance systems","Data structures; Decay (organic); Computing system; False positive; Intrinsic property; On-line applications; Performance issues; Software and hardwares; Storage medium; Surveillance applications; Dynamic random access storage",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096861111

However, existing digital signatures might not be fully practical for such resource-constrained devices (e.g., medical implants) that have energy limitations. Some other computationally efficient alternatives (e.g., one-Time/multiple-Time signatures) may introduce high memory and/or communication overhead due to large private key and signature sizes. In this paper, our contributions are two-fold: First, we develop a new lightweight multiple-Time digital signature scheme called Signer Efficient Multiple-Time Elliptic Curve Signature (\mathtt {SEMECS}{}SEMECS), which is suitable for resource-constrained embedded devices. \mathtt {SEMECS}{}SEMECS achieves optimal signature and private key sizes for an EC-based signature without requiring any EC operation (e.g., EC scalar multiplication or addition) at the signer. We prove \mathtt {SEMECS}{}SEMECS is secure (in random oracle model) with a tight security reduction. Second, we fully implemented \mathtt {SEMECS}{}SEMECS on 8-bit AVR microprocessor with a comprehensive energy consumption analysis and comparison. Our experiments confirm up to 19× less battery-consumption for \mathtt {SEMECS}{}SEMECS as compared to its fastest (full-Time) counterpart, SchnorrQ, while offering significant performance advantages over its multiple-Time counterparts in various fronts.

To improve the safety and practicability of machinery, fault diagnostic systems have become essential. This study employed a neural network algorithm to implement fault diagnosis. This study proposed a 3D printer fault diagnostic system that incorporated a neural network with a graphic interface. The MPU6050 accelerometer was combined with an Arduino microcontroller to monitor the status of a 3D printer. The neural network simulated the relationships of faults and training, and adopted different transfer functions to compare their training and convergence performance. The data were transferred to Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench after training and were displayed on a human machine interface, enabling users to explicitly identify the potential location of faults in a machine. This system ameliorates the work efficiency of managers and achieves real-time fault diagnosis. Moreover, the proposed 3D printer fault diagnostic system identified neural network parameters (e.g., the number of neurons, the learning rate, and the number of training) suitable for this system through various static and dynamic simulation experiments. Various shapes were adopted for testing the detection rate of the 3D printer fault diagnostic system. Finally, the real-time dynamic printing status data were recorded for approximately 10 min consecutively, yielding 6000 pieces of data, and that the transfer functions in the hidden and output layers were adopted for static simulation. The results showed that the overall fault detection rate of the system was as high as 83.5%. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"Failure analysis; Fault detection; Internet of things; Neural networks; Personnel training; Printing presses; Transfer functions; Convergence performance; Dynamic simulation experiment; Fault diagnostic systems; Human Machine Interface; Laboratory virtual instrument engineering work-bench; Neural network algorithm; Neural network parameters; Real-time fault diagnosis; 3D printers",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061399808

The antenna pattern comprises a circular patch with the double stepped symmetric ground plane and is fed by a coplanar waveguide (CPW) technique on one-sided photo paper. The system is designed, simulated, fabricated, and tested experimentally. It operates over 3.2–30 GHz (161% fractional bandwidth, FBW) range with a return loss of − 10 dB or less and a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) < 2. The proposed monopole antenna is of dimensions 33.1 mm × 32.7 mm × 0.254 mm with an electrical size of 0.35 λ × 0.35 λ at 3.2 GHz frequency. This design exhibits nearly omnidirectional radiation pattern over the entire impedance bandwidth. An average gain of 4.87 and a radiation efficiency of 86.61% was observed. The miniature size, higher operating range, relatively constant radiation pattern along with higher acceptable peak gain of the antenna on a paper substrate lend itself to wearable and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"Antenna feeders; Antenna grounds; Bandwidth; Coplanar waveguides; Electric impedance; Flexible electronics; Internet of things; Microstrip antennas; Microwave antennas; Monopole antennas; Slot antennas; Ultra-wideband (UWB); Wearable antennas; Coplanar wave-guide (CPW); Fractional bandwidths; Impedance bandwidths; Internet of Things (IOT); Omnidirectional radiation pattern; Radiation efficiency; Research and development; Voltage standing-wave ratio; Directional patterns (antenna)",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058659168
